The mounting member may be foamed as it is molded to provide voids therein for storage of gas or the recesses in which the electrochemical cells are mounted may be supplied with sponge-like pads for absorbing excess gas until it can permeate through the encapsulant to reduce pressure build-up within the device and prevent cracking of the casing.", "background": "\nOur invention relates to an implantable electrically actuated medical device, such as a cardiac pacer, and more particularly to an improved device of this type which has gas storage characteristics.\nDevices of this type are normally energized and powered from either separate or self-contained electrochemical cells or batteries which tend to deplete chemically and with such depletion generate a hydrogen gas. Inasmuch as devices of this type are normally encapsulated with an epoxy resin which is highly impermeable to the hydrogen gas, the encapsulated structure under conditions of cell deterioration will occasion substantial internal pressure build-up with the risk of an explosion or splitting of the encapsulating casing.\nThe present invention is directed to an improved device of this type in which means are provided in the construction of the device and beneath the encapsulation to absorb any hydrogen gas evolving from the electrochemical cells energizing the same. In the present invention, the components of the electrically operated medical device are positioned in a mounting structure which is generally made of a material which is highly permeable to the hydrogen gas relative to the encapsulating material or epoxy resin the material of such a structure being foamed to provide spaces or voids therein to provide a reservoir space for the gas, releasing or reducing internal pressure until the gas may be permeated through the encapsulation. An alternate arrangement is provided in which the mounting structure for the cells and electrical device includes a separate sponge-like material for the same purpose.\nIt is the principle object of this invention to provide an improved electrically actuated medical device having gas absorption characteristics.\nAnother object of this invention is to provide an improved electrically actuated medical device of the implantable type in which the internal construction permits absorption of hydrogen gas generated by power-sources or other electrochemical cells which have a gas byproduct.\nThese and other objects of this invention will become apparent from the reading of the attached description, together with the drawings, wherein:\nFIG. 1 is a perspective view of the improved implantable electrically actuated medical device;\nFIG. 2 is a plan view of the device of FIG. 1 with parts broken away to show the arrangement of parts therein;\nFIG. 3 is a sectional view of the device of FIG. 2 taken along the lines 3--3 therein and with parts broken away; and,\nFIG. 4 is a sectional view similar to FIG. 3 of the device showing an alternate embodiment of the invention.\nOur improved electrically operated and implantable medical device is shown in perspective in FIG. 1 simulating a cardiac pacer. Although the invention shown is herein in connection with an implantable cardiac pacer, it will be understood that it may take varying forms within the scope of the invention including other implantable medical devices.\nAs shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the implantable medical device includes an encapsulation 15 of an epoxy resin covering a plurality of electrochemical cells 25 typically of the alkaline zinc-mercury type which are positioned in a mounting member 30 along with a sealed can or housing for the electronic circuitry of the device indicated generally at 20. The cells 25 are interconnected to one another and to the input terminals of the device, as indicated by the conductors 35, and the implantable device has a coupling member extending through the encapsulation as indicated at 11 with suitable output leads 12 extending therefrom and to electrodes (not shown) or other apparatus associated with the device. The details of the electrochemical cells and the electronic circuitry are omitted for simplicity since they form no part of the present invention. The cells are of the type which generate a gas, such as hydrogen upon depletion. The epoxy resin covering or encapsulation provides a relatively liquid tight seal for the device of a material which is biocompatible and liquid impervious. Where the voids liquid light or liquid impervious are used herein, it is meant that the resin will not pass fluid in liquid form while recognizing that the plastic resin will transmit small amounts of vapor. The epoxy resin covering is also relatively impermeable to any hydrogen gas generated in the cells. Such generation of gas takes place with cell depletion with the gas being vented from a suitable vent port, indicated at 40, in the base of the cell and to some degree through the cell seal spacing the cell electrodes. Because the epoxy resin material is relatively impermeable to gas any sudden release of the same will create a pressure build-up within the encapsulation which may cause fracture or explosion of the same.\nIn the present invention, as indicated in FIG. 3, the mounting member 30 is formed of a highly hydrogen permeable plastic which may advantageously be a polyphenyleneoxide/polystyrene material commercially available under the trademark \"NORYL\" as manufactured by the General Electric Company. The mounting member or spacer 30 has recesses 45 therein in which the cells and electronic circuit can 20 are positioned. The mounting member provides for location of the parts and rigidity to the package to support the encapsulation which bonds well with the mounting material to seal the same. In the present invention, the material forming and mounting member is constructed of a structural foam providing voids or spaces in the mounting member, as indicated at 55, which act as a reservoir for the hydrogen gas when released from the cells through the vent extremity 45 thereof. The mounting material of polyphenyleneoxide/polystyrene is of considerably higher permeability to hydrogen gas than is the epoxy resin and is also biocompatible with body fluids. The release of gas from the cells is absorbed in the voids or foamed spacer member to provide a very slow development of pressure within the casing permitting diffusion of the gas or release of the same through the encapsulant material or epoxy resin gradually without an excessive pressure build-up from the same.\nAs an alternate embodiment of this invention, as indicated in FIG. 4, the recesses 45 in the mounting member beneath the electrochemical cells or batteries may have a thin layer of sponge material 60 positioned therein which sponge material will face the vent 40 extremity of the cells to increase the free volume of gas to occupy within the mounting member and the encapsulation. The use of the sponge material with voids therein to store the gas permits the gradual release of the same and prevents pressure build-up within the encapsulated device. In this embodiment, the spacer or mounting member may be made solid rather than foamed with reliance on the sponge-like pads positioned adjacent and in contact with the vent ends of the electrochemical cells within the recesses of the device providing the storage space for the excess to reduce pressure build-up within the encapsulant and permit diffusion of the same through the mounting member and the encapsulant.\nIn the description given above, the foamed material has been given as polyphenyleneoxide/polystyrene plastic. This material while suitable to purposes of the invention, is not the only usable plastic. What is required is that the plastic be foamable to produce a structural foam body that holds the assembly in position, provides a temporary storage space for evolved hydrogen and has good hydrogen permeability relative to the epoxy encapsulant. It also should bond readily to the epoxy.\nIn considering this invention, it should be remembered that the present disclosure is illustrative only and the scope of the invention should be determined by the appended claims.\n", "claims": "\nWhat we claim is:\n \n1.

Tree formation can be prevented if the insulation is initially dry and the cable construction is such that moisture cannot gain access to the insulation under operating conditions encountered during installation and underground use. This invention eliminates initial moisture and has a construction that greatly retards ingress of moisture to the insulation during installation when the cable is in service and prevents longitudinal movement of water along the cable due to accidental damage to the cable or electrical failure.", "background": "\nBACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nExtruded solid dielectric cables installed underground over the last 15 years have been found to contain tree or bushlike patterns in the insulation. These patterns called \"electrochemical trees\" result from moisture penetration into the insulation under normal operating electrical stress due to high electrical stresses developed locally by insulation imperfections.\nUnder most operating conditions when extruded dielectric power cables are installed underground the ingress of moisture shortens the life of these cables prematurely because of the formation of these electrochemical trees in the insulation. These trees form at normal operating stress over a period of years depending somewhat on local environment and particular cable construction. The trees will not form if the insulation is initially dry or free of water and remains this way throughout its operating life. This condition can be achieved initially by an extruded lead sheath or other hermetic enclosure.\nThe trees represent channels which are filled with the liquid. The dielectric strength of the channels is lower than that of insulation. When the channels progress more than 50% throughout the insulation, the dielectric strength of the insulation is decreased to such an extent that electrical failure of the cable may occur under typical over-voltage conditions. Further progression of the channels into the insulation may cause failures at even operating voltages. The electrochemical trees are originated at insulation imperfections located within the insulation wall or at sharp irregularities at the interfaces of the insulation and the conductor and insulation shields. Typically, the electrochemical trees progress from high voltage stress areas caused by these imperfections into a low voltage stress area away from the imperfections.\nAs will be developed later, the purpose of this invention is to provide a special design of cable which, initially free of moisture in its components, is filled with moisture resistant materials to prevent sufficient moisture ingress and longitudinal movement during the active life of the cable to prematurely cause the cable to fail due to the formation of electrochemical trees.\nCables with extruded lead and aluminum sheaths have been used to prevent moisture ingress into the insulation and thereby retard the formation of electrochemical trees. Cables with welded sheaths, such as copper, aluminum and steel have also been used for the same purpose. However, these constructions have not been entirely satisfactory because moisture enters from the ends of the cable and at places where the sheath is damaged or has become corroded and progresses along the cable and into the insulation.\nWhile these various expedients have been used to prevent moisture from getting into cables and destroying the effectiveness of certain types of insulation, such cable designs have not been effective in preventing the formation of electrochemical trees in the insulation over a period of years due to corrosion and damage to the metallic shield. In addition, metallic sheathed cables are high in cost, difficult to handle when large in diameter, and expensive to splice and terminate. This invention provides a combination of moisture repellent features that prevent or greatly delay the formation of electrochemical trees in power cable insulation and thereby extends substantially the useful life of the cable.\nOther objects, features and advantages of the invention will appear or be pointed out as the description proceeds.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING\nIn the drawing, forming a part hereof, in which like reference characters indicate corresponding parts in all the views:\nFIG. 1 is an isometric view, with different parts broken away progressively along the length of a cable made in accordance with this invention;\nFIG. 2 is an enlarged sectional view taken on the line 2--2 of FIG. 1;\nFIG. 3 is a detail view, similar to FIG. 1, but showing a modified construction of a portion of the cable;\nFIG. 4 is a view similar to FIG. 3 but showing a second modified form of the invention;\nFIG. 5 is a diagrammatic sectional view showing how the strip for the longitudinally folded strip can be preformed to obtain a better seam; and\nFIG. 6 shows a modified construction with a braided wire metal shield and flooding compound over a helically wrapped semi-conducting tape insulation shield.\nDESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT\nFIG. 1 shows a power cable 10 which includes a center conductor 12 made up of a plurality of strands 14 which are cabled together and covered by a semi-conducting conductor shield 16 such as in conventional with high voltage power cables. The space between strands 14 is filled with a filling compound which constitutes a strand sealant indicated by stippling and designated by the reference character 18 in FIG. 1. This sealant 18 completely fills all spaces between the strands 14 so that there can be no moisture in the strands when the stranded conductor 12 is covered by the conductor shield 16.\nThe conductor shield 16 is preferably extruded over the conductor 12 and there is sufficient sealant 18 on the conductor 12 so that as the shield 16 is extruded over the conductor, all space between the conductor strands and the shield 16 are filled with sealant surrounding the conductor and preventing any moisture from being in the space surrounded by the shield 16. The extruded material forming the conductor shield 16 extends into contact with the filled conductor and comes into contact with the sealant. The extruded shield 16 extends into the depressions between outside strands 14, as shown in FIG. 2. The shield 16 fits so tightly around the conductor 12 that no moisture can penetrate along the interfaces between the inside surface of the shield 16 and the surfaces of the conductor 12.\nThe sealant 18 may be an asphalt/rubber or a polyester compound. These materials are named by way of illustration and are preferred materials; but it will be understood that other filling compound can be used as the sealant if it is compatible with the material of the semi-conducting shield 16 and the insulation 20. If desired, a semi-conducting tape can be placed over the strands of the conductor 12 and the shield 16 can be extruded over this tape. Such a tape can be used if necessary to reduce migration of any ingredients of the strand sealant into the conductor shield 16. When such a semi-conducting tape is used, all spaces between it and the conductor are thoroughly filled with the sealant 18 and adheres to the semi-conducting shield 16. In place of the semi-conducting shield 16 a layer of high dielectric constant material can be used to serve as the stress control layer.\nThe conductor shield 16 is preferably polyethylene, cross-linked polyethylene, ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) or a blend of these materials. The shield is made conducting by the use of carbon black, and it is resistant to the longitudinal migration of moisture or it may be a high dielectric constant stress control material.\nInsulation 20 is then extruded over the conductor shield 16. The insulation 20 is preferably polyethylene or cross-linked polyethylene and it is this insulation that is protected against the formation of electrochemical trees. Other suitable insulation can be used such as ethylene-propylene rubber and polyvinyl chloride.\nThe insulation 20 is extruded tightly over the conductor shield 16 or stress control layer and bonded to it. It is not possible for moisture to penetrate along the interface between the insulation 20 and the conductor shield 16 from cable ends.\nAn insulation shield 24 is extruded directly over and bonded to the insulation 20. This insulation shield 24 is tightly extruded and because of the tight extrusion and fusion bonding, no moisture can penetrate along the interface between the insulation 20 and shield 24. Shield 24 is preferably made of the same material as the conductor shield 16.\nThere is a semi-conducting filler material 26 placed over the outside surface of the semi-conducting insulation shield 24. This semi-conducting filler 26 sticks to the insulation shield 24; and it may be made of the same material as the sealant 18 which is used in the conductor 12, but with the addition of carbon black or other conducting material in sufficient quantity to make the material 26 a semi-conductor.\nThe purpose of the semi-conducting filler 26 is to provide moisture resistance around the outside of the insulation shield 24. The filler 26 is compatible with the insulation shield 24 and the insulation 20.\nA metallic shield 30 surrounds the insulation shield 24 outside of the filler 26 and is wrapped around the insulation shield 24 in such a way that the filler 26 occupies any space between the insulation shield 24 and the metallic shield 30. The metallic shield 30 is preferably made of aluminum or copper. It is preferably applied by folding it longitudinally around the insulation shield 24, and it is preferably corrugated to permit easier bending of the cable 10. This longitudinally folded metallic shield 30 has a lap seam indicated by the reference character 32 and is preferred over the conventional tape shield applied helically around the insulation shield because the longitudinally folded lap seam metallic shield 30 permit expansion of the cable core as the result of thermal cycling. A helically wound tape applied to a cable core cannot adequately provide for such thermal expansion and subsequent contraction and for handling high fault currents typical of electric utility transmission and distribution systems.\nThe edges of the metallic shield 30 at the lap seam 32 are free to move circumferentially with respect to one another when the cable expands with increase in temperature; and the metal of the shield 30 again contracts to maintain its tight contact around the underlying core of the cable when the cable cools and contracts.\nThe lap seam metallic shield 30 with the space under it, including the corrugations, filled with the semi-conducting filler material 26 retards moisture ingress into any spaces between the insulation 24 and shield 30. Such an aluminum or copper shield 30 is preferred over lead as lead corrodes easily and builds up the diameter of the cable excessively.\nAt the lap seam 32 of the folded corrugated shield 30, there is preferably placed a bridging tape 36 which extends across the edge of the shield 30 that is on the outside of the seam 32. This bridging tape which may be made of Mylar (Polyethylene terephthalate) or a polyester prevents the outer edge of the lap seam 32 from indenting into an overall extruded outer jacket 40 which is extruded over the shield 30 and the bridging tape 36. This outer jacket 40 is preferably polyethylene compounded with ultra violet protecting agents to prevent damage by sunlight if the cable is exposed to sunlight. If desired, the overall jacket 40 can be made of polyvinyl chloride or chlorinated polyethylene. Its function is to provide mechanical protection for the cable prior to installation, during installation, and while in service.\nThere is a filler or flooding compound 42 applied over the metallic shield 30 and the bridging tape 36. This filler 42 serves as a sealant outside of the shield 30 just as the material 26 serves as a sealant inside the corrugated shield 30. The filler 42 can be made of the same material as the filler 26 and some of it can be applied to the lapped surfaces of the seam 32 and it is also applied to the shield 30 before the bridging tape 36 is placed along the seam 32. Thus all of the space, which might otherwise be open, between any corrugations of the metallic shield 30 and other components of the cable that confront these corrugations is filled with sealant 26 and/or 42. The sealant 42 must be compatible with the overall jacket 40; and it serves to prevent water or moisture from reaching the metallic shield in the event that the outer or overall jacket 40 becomes punctured.\nFIG. 5 shows a preformed strip or metal shield 30b which has an edge portion 43 bent transversely out of the plane of the rest of the shield 30b so that when the shield is folded longitudinally around the cable, with the edge 43 on the outside of the lap seam, the edge portion of the lower edge portion of the lap and the bridging tape 36 is unnecessary. This preforming can be done to the flat strip or during the folding of the strip 30b. The edge portion is bent to a radius of curvature approximately equal to the radius of the outside surface of the insulation shield, and preferably slightly less.\nFIG. 3 shows a modified construction for the cable of this invention. Parts of the cable of FIG. 3 which correspond with those of FIG. 1 are indicated by the same reference character with a prime appended. The cable 10' of FIG. 3 has an insulation shield 24' which is the same as the corresponding insulation shield in FIG. 1 and all parts of the cable inside of the insulation shield 24' are the same as the construction shown in FIG. 1.\nThe cable 10' of FIG. 3 differs from the cable shown in FIG. 1 in that it has a longitudinally folded tape 46 around the insulation shield 24' in place of the flooding compound 26 of FIG. 1.\nThis tape 46 is preferably made of aluminum foil coated on both sides with polyethylene and with the polyethylene adhered to the foil tenaciously by having reactive carboxyl groups in the polyethylene coating. The longitudinally folded tape 46 has a lap seam, indicated by the reference character 48, and the confronting edge portions of the tape 46 at the lap seam are preferably bonded together to make a moisture proof layer provided by the tape 46 which is mostly plastic and capable of expanding circumferentially as necessary to accommodate thermal cycling of the cable.\nA metallic shield 30', similar to the shield 30 of FIG. 1 surrounds the folded tape 46 and has a bridging tape 36' over which an overall jacket is extruded as in the construction shown in FIG. 1. The folded tape 46 takes the place of the flooding material 26 of FIG. 1 in providing a moisture proof layer around the insulation shield. The cable 10' can be made with filler material, such as the material 42 of FIG. 1, around the outside of the shield 30' and the bridging tape 36'. The cable 10' can be made without any flooding material on the outside of the shield 30 if full reliance is going to be placed on the folded tape 46 for keeping moisture away from the insulation shield 24'.\nFIG. 4 shows another modified form of the invention with parts corresponding to those of FIG. 1 indicated by the same reference character with an \"a\" appended. This construction of FIG. 4 differs from that shown in FIG. 3 in that a tape 50 made of uncured semi-conducting rubber is folded around the insulation shield 24a. This rubber tape 50 is relied upon to keep moisture from reaching the insulation shield 24a. The cable 10a has a corrugated metallic shield 30a with a bridging tape 36a surrounded by an outer jacket (not shown).\nThe semi-conducting uncured rubber tape 50 is folded with a lap seam, indicated by the reference character 52a and the rubber is soft enough to fill the corrugations of the underside of the folded corrugated metallic shield 30a. The tape 50 prevents longitudinal flow of water along the cable core.\nConventional shields such as helically applied tape and wire shields can be used but are less desirable than the longitudinally folded shield with lap seam. When wire shield is used only, the same conducting flooding compound 26 is used.\nFIG. 6 shows a construction in which a cable 10b has extruded insulation 20b with a semi-conducting insulation shield having an overlapping tape 56 helically wrapped around the insulation 20b and adhered to the insulation 20b. A metal braided wire screen 58 is applied over the tape 56 and is flooded with sealant 26. An extruded jacket 40b surrounds the wire shield 58.\nIn connection with the construction shown in FIGS. 3, 4 and 6, it should be kept in mind that the invention is primarily intended to prevent moisture from reaching the insulation of the cable and forming, over a number of years, electrochemical trees within the insulation and reducing the ability of the insulation to withstand the high voltage stresses for which it is intended. The tape 46 of FIG. 3 and the rubber tape 50 of FIG. 4 do provide protection from ingress of moisture to the cable core. However, the construction shown in FIG. 1 is the preferred embodiment in that it provides added protection against the ingress of moisture into the cable by means of flooding compound or sealant 42 between the overall jacket 40 and the metallic shield 30 and also by the sealant or flooding material 26 between the metallic shield 30 and the insulation shield 24.\nThe preferred embodiment of the invention and some modifications have been illustrated and described, but other modifications can be made and some features can be used in different combinations without departing from the invention as defined in the claims.\n", "claims": "\nWhat is claimed is:\n \n1.

Their treatment with aqueous solutions of ammonia or ammonium sulfites results in an efficient purification thereof and in the production of aqueous solutions of ammonium salts of oxygen and sulfur containing acids, which solutions may be easily converted to sulfur, a product which may be stored easily, is not polluting and may be used in industry.\nThere still remain, however, in the resultant scrubbed gases, small amounts of sulfur dioxide and ammonia which may result in a wreath of smoke at the stack outlet. Sufficient reheating of the evolved gas could reduce or suppress this wreath of smoke, but this would be a costly operation.\nWe have now found that when the gases previously purified by any of the above means were thereafter washed with a dilute aqueous solution of ammonium sulfate, they could be made substantially free of any residual sulfur dioxide and ammonia, thereby avoiding the formation of smoke attributable to the ammonium salts.\nThe respective amounts of sulfur dioxide and ammonia in the gas evolved from the purification stage and which must be treated are usually less than 300 ppm and, in most cases, in the range of from 50 to 250 ppm by volume.\nThe process of the invention consists of contacting a gas containing small amounts of sulfur dioxide and ammonia with a diluted aqueous solution of ammonium sulfate, so as to obtain a solution containing ammonium sulfites whose major part will be oxidized, in order to transform the relatively volatile sulfites to sulfates which are stable compounds.\nThe contact between the gas and the ammonium sulfate solution may be carried out in an apparatus separate from that used for the preliminary purification of the gas with aqueous ammonia-containing solutions. Alternatively a multistage column may be used, the washing step according to the invention being carried out in the upper section with liquid discharge from the bottom of this upper section.\nThe temperature at the outlet from the purification stage is about from 40\u00b0to 70\u00b0C, usually 50\u00b0C, i.e. close to the dew point of the waste-gas.\nThis temperature is convenient for the purpose of the invention and does not need modification. However, a slight cooling in this zone, which favors the coalescence of entrained liquid droplets, improves the washing performance.\nRelatively large amounts of washing solution may be used at such rates that the ammonium sulfite concentration is very low, i.e. has a value of about 0.02 to 0.5 mole per liter, preferably 0.05 mole per liter at the outlet of the washing zone.\nDuring the contact of the aqueous solution with the gas, sulfur dioxide and ammonia dissolve and produce in the resulting solution a mixture of ammonium neutral sulfite and ammonium hydrogen sulfite in variable proportions, depending on the composition of the treated gas. In the described conditions, this solution is very dilute, and the oxidation of the sulfites to ammonium sulfate may be obtained without any difficulty, said sulfate being not liable to decompose when the solution is recirculated.\nNow, in order to carry out this oxidation under good conditions, it is advantageous to sufficiently enrich the solution with ammonium neutral sulfite. If the gas treated does not contain sufficient ammonia, additional ammonia may be supplied, for example, either as gas or as aqueous solution, in order to make the medium subject to oxidation slightly basic.\nThe conventional oxidation methods, for example the techniques according to which air or a gaseous oxygen-containing mixture is bubbled, the electrochemical techniques or the catalytic methods may be used.\nThere is thus obtained a solution containing substantially only ammonium sulfate, which is recycled to the zone of contact with the purified gas up to obtaining a sulfate content between 0.5 and 3 moles per liter, preferably about 1 mole per liter. This concentration is controlled by periodically or continuously withdrawing a small amount of solution from the circuit, this amount being, for example, about one-twentieth of the circulating volume, and replacing it, if desired, with water.\nThis withdrawn purge solution may be without inconvenience fed to the zone of gas purification since it contains only sulfate and a small amount of ammonium sulfite.\nThe reactor in which the oxidation is carried out may be provided, for example, with one or more perforated plates or with a packing, so as to improve, when bubbling is desired, the contact between the gas flow and the circulated solution.\nOxidation catalysts are helpful, for example cobalt, iron, nickel, manganese or vanadium salts.\nAshes produced by burning a heavy fuel, for example fuel-oil, contain some of these metals and may be used by dispersing them through the circulated solution.\nAnother method consists of electrochemically oxidizing the sulfites to sulfate in an electrolytic cell which may be provided with a cation-permeable membrane between the anodic and cathodic compartments.\nThe cell is fed with the ammonium sulfite solution; it is provided, on the anode side, with corrosion-free metal electrodes, for example of lead, silver, platinum or alloys containing at least one of these metals; on the cathode side, the electrodes may be made of these metals or of less noble metals, such as nickel, copper, iron or steel.\nThe cation-permeable membrane may consist of a cation-exchange material or an organic material such as, for example, cross-linked polystyrene sulfonate, linked to a film-forming base material.\nA partial oxidation of the sulfites to sulfate occurs in the anodic compartment of the cell, said oxidation being enhanced, if necessary, for example, by bubbling air through the solution. if a membrane is used, the solution contained in the cathode compartment is converted to a solution of neutral ammonium sulfite by means of the NH4 + ions which have passed through the membrane. This solution may then be easily oxidized to ammonium sulfate; this oxidation may be carried out by passing the neutral sulfite solution through an additional reactor in which, for example, air is bubbled.\nConditions for rapid oxidation of the sulfites may be achieved by modifying, if necessary, the pH of the solution by adding thereto a make-up quantity of the solution issued from the anode compartment, so that the pH value is maintained below, for example, about 9.\nThe purge fraction may be usefully collected at this point of the circuit.\nThe following examples, given in non-limitative manner, illustrate the invention.\nEXAMPLE 1 (FIG. 1)\nAn absorption column (19) in which a SO2 -containing waste gas is treated with an aqueous ammonia-containing solution (NH3 + ammonium sulfites) is provided at its upper part with an additional stage 1 for washing the purified fumes containing 200 ppm of SO2 and 150 ppm of NH3 by volume.\nThis additional zone, where the temperature is about 50\u00b0C, is fed from line 2 with 100,000 Nm3 per hour of waste gas.\nThe aqueous solution employed for absorbing SO2 and NH3 from the waste-gas and whose composition is given hereinafter is supplied from line 3 to the upper part of this zone and is withdrawn through line 4 from the lower part thereof.\nIts composition is then 4.6 g per liter of ammonium sulfite and its flow rate 20 m3 per hours. It is fed through lines 4, 5 and 6 to the oxidation reactor 7 which comprises an electrolytic cell provided with platinum electrodes (anode 8, cathode 9) on which the current density is 40 milliamperes per cm2 and whose anode and cathode compartments are separated by a membrane 10 of Permion 1010.\nThe (NH4)2 SO3 solution, withdrawn through line 13 from the cathode compartment of the cell and whose pH has been brought to about 8 by means of material supplied through line 14 from the anode compartment, is passed to the reactor 11, through which air supplied from line 12 is bubbled.\nThere is thus obtained a solution containing 83 g of (NH4)2 SO4 per liter, from which about 1.3 m3 per hour are discharged through line 15, the remainder being fed through line 16 to the absorber.\nThe solution recovered at the outlet of the cell (anodic side) also contains 83 g of ammonium sulfate per liter when the plant is in running condition. It is fed back through line 3 to the purification zone 1. About 1.3 m3 per hour of water is supplied from line 17.\nThe waste-gas discharged through stack 18 contains only 12 ppm of SO2 by volume and is free of ammonia. 1.2 m3 per hour of water and 97 liters per hour of 10 M ammonia are supplied through line 17.\nThe pumps and valves of the plant and the direct current generator feeding the electrolytic cell have not been shown.\nEXAMPLE 2 (FIG. 2)\nThe conditions of concentration and feed rate are the same as in example 1, but the electrolytic cell is not provided with a cation-permeable membrane.\nThe partially purified waste-gas is fed from line 29 to the absorber 20. The ammonium sulfate solution used for washing the fumes is fed to the absorber through line 21 and is discharged through line 22. It goes through the electrolytic cell 23, in which the electrode current density is 100 milliamperes/cm2, and is discharged through line 24. It is fed to a reactor 25 through which air supplied from line 30 is bubbled, and subsequently discharged and fed back to the absorber 20 through line 21.\nLine 26 is used for withdrawing a fraction of the solution and line 27 for supplying additional water. The waste-gas is discharged through stack 28.\nThe results are the same as in example 1, except that the solution discharged through line 26 at a rate of 1.1 m3 /hour contains 81.6 g of ammonium sulfate per liter.\nEXAMPLE 3\nExample 1 is repeated, except that the electrolytic cell is not present and is replaced by a unit for oxidation by air in the presence of a cobalt catalyst.\nThe effluent is partly fed back to zone 1 and partly discharged.\nThe resulting purified waste-gas contains less than 10 ppm of SO2 and less than 10 ppm of NH3 by volume.\n", "claims": "\nWhat we claimed is:\n \n1.

This abstract is neither intended to define the invention covered by this application, which, of course, is measured by the claims, nor is it intended to be limiting as to the scope of the invention in any way.", "background": "\nThe invention relates to a method for the manufacture of an electrode material containing silver and tungsten carbide for electrochemical cells, particularly fuel cells and storage cells, by means of reduction of a silver tungstate and a subsequent carburization.\nIt is known to employ tungsten carbide as a catalyst for the anodic oxidation of fuels, for instance, hydrogen, in fuel cells with an acidic electrolyte. Tungsten carbide may be made, for instance, by carburizing metallic tungsten with carbon, carbon black, or carbon-containing gases, such as carbon monoxide and methane, at temperatures above about 700\u00b0C. For the manufacture of bonded gas electrodes, tungsten carbide powder may be mixed with polymers as binders and pore-forming agents or with porous additives, such as activated carbon, and can be cold or hot molded (see \"Energy Conversion\", Vol. 10 pp. 25-28 (1970)).\nDifficulties are encountered in the manufacture of unbonded electrodes which contain the electrode catalytic material in powder form. In the preparation of tungsten carbide from tungstic acid by reduction with hydrogen and carburation with carbon monoxide, for instance, the tungsten carbide thereby obtained has a mean particle size of less than about 1 micron; particles of larger diameter have too little surface area for electrode purposes in electrochemical cells. Employing particles of small diameter in powder electrodes leads to various difficulties. For one, the application of electrical contacts is a problem, as a conducting screen or fabric which is gas-permeable cannot be made economically and furthermore has pores so fine that the catalyst particles cannot get through the fabric into the gas chamber. On the other hand, the diameter of the pores (interstices) which form between the particles, depends on the size of the particles. Narrow pores between small particles develop high capillary pressures if they are filled with liquid, and the presence of a three-phase boundary can be created only by the use of very high gas pressures.\nThese difficulties are not present in bonded electrodes, because during the manufacture of such electrodes transport pores can be produced, by the introduction of pore-forming agents according to known methods, which are filled with gas even at low gas pressures and thereby readily permit the transport of the reaction gas to the point of the reaction. The use of organic binders, however, can have a detrimental effect, particularly in high-performance electrodes, since the binders have insulating properties and thereby impede the conduction of the current, and exclude a portion of the particles entirely from the conduction of the current, and hence from participation in the electrochemical process.\nGerman Offenlegungsschrift No. 1,939,127 describes a method for the manufacture of an electrode containing tungsten carbide for fuel cells in which the fine tungsten carbide particles are held together by silver, so that particles with a larger diameter are produced. For preparing the catalyst material, the silver salt of a tungstic acid, preferably silver metatungstate, is reduced and carburized at elevated temperature, whereby silver-containing tungsten carbide (Ag-WC) particles are formed. Such particles have a grain diameter approximately in the range of between about 10 and about 80 microns. The electrode material is distinguished by a high load capacity due to its advantageous structure; in addition to the diameter of the particles, which is well-suited for use in powder electrodes, the electrode material has a sufficiently large surface area, approximately in the range of 5 m2 /g (as determined by the BET method). In manufacturing larger quantities of electrode material, however, it is difficult to obtain uniform reproducibility which is particularly observable in the electrochemical properties of the product electrode.\nIt is an object of the invention to provide a further improved method for the manufacture of an electrode material containing silver and tungsten carbide for electrochemical cells, particularly fuel cells and storage cells, by the reduction of a silver tungstate and subsequent carburizing. In addition, an electrode material with greater activity is obtained, which, furthermore, has a reduced silver content.\nBroadly stated, the process comprises forming a suspension of finely divided particles of tungsten carbide in an aqueous solution of a tungstate, adding to such suspension a solution of a silver salt, thereby forming a precipitate of silver tungstate, separating from the reaction mixture a mixture of tungsten carbide and precipitated silver tungstate, reducing the silver tungstate in such mixture to metallic silver and tungsten, and carburizing such metallic tungsten to tungsten carbide, thereby obtaining silver-containing tungsten carbide particles.\nIn a particularly preferred embodiment of the process, a suspension of tungsten carbide particles having a mean grain size of less than about 1 micron is suspended in an aqueous solution of an alkali metal tungstate, preferably sodium metatungstate (Na2 O.4 WO3). The amount of tungsten, considered as elemental tungsten, in the tungsten carbide particles is preferably equal to the tungsten in the tungstate solution. To such solution and while it is being vigorously agitated, an aqueous solution of silver nitrate is slowly added, preferably dropwise, thereby precipitating silver metatungstate which envelopes the existing tungsten carbide particles and joins them together to form particles of larger size, in the range of 10-80 microns. After the agitation is stopped, the supernatant liquid is decanted, and the precipitate dried. Then the silver metatungstate in such precipitate is reduced to metallic silver and tungsten in a flowing stream of hydrogen at a temperature in the range of about 400\u00b0 to about 600\u00b0C, preferably about 540\u00b0C. Thereafter such metallic tungsten is carburized by treatment with flowing carbon monoxide at a temperature in the range of about 800\u00b0 to 1000\u00b0C, preferably about 840\u00b0C, thus producing the silver-containing tungsten carbide particles having an average size in the range of 10 to about 80 microns. Further details of the process are explained in the following paragraphs.\nThe reduction step in which the silver tungstate contained in the mixture is reduced to metallic silver and tungsten is advantageously done with hydrogen at a temperature in the range of between about 400\u00b0 and about 600\u00b0C, and preferably at about 540\u00b0C. The reduction may also be performed in two steps, in which the reduction is first performed in the above-mentioned temperature range, and thereafter proceeds in a temperature range between about 600\u00b0 and 800\u00b0C, preferably at about 700\u00b0C.\nThe carburizing step, in which the tungsten of the now-existing silver, tungsten and tungsten carbide mixture is converted into tungsten carbide, is advantageously performed with a normally-gaseous, carbon-containing compound, particularly carbon monoxide or a low molecular weight hydrocarbon, such as methane, acetylene or benzene, at a temperature in the range of between about 800\u00b0 and about 1000\u00b0C. Carbon, particularly in the form of carbon black, may also be employed. The carburizing step is preferably performed with carbon monoxide at between about 820\u00b0 and 840\u00b0C.\nIn order to improve the electro-catalytic properties of the product electrode material, the reducing and carburizing steps may also be repeated at the same conditions employed in the initial reducing and carburizing steps.\nMetatungstates are preferred in the process because they have the advantage that only a small amount of silver is involved, since the silver tungstate formed in the course of the process is the tungstate with the lowest weight percentage of silver. On the other hand, other known tungstates with different stoichiometry offer the option of adjusting the concentration of the silver in the product electrode material. In addition, the silver content in the product may also be controlled by varying the ratio of the starting products, i.e., tungstate and tungsten carbide. If the amount of tungsten (on an elemental basis) in the metatungstate and in the tungsten carbide in the suspension are equal, the finished electrode material has a silver content of about 10% by weight.\nSilver nitrate is preferably employed as the silver salt, but other soluble silver salts may also be employed, for instance, silver acetate or silver fluoride. The silver salt is preferably in the form of an aqueous solution, because with such a solution, the precipitation of silver tungstate can be readily controlled.\nThe electrode material prepared in accordance with the invention, which contains silver and tungsten carbide, exhibits a uniformly high electrochemical activity, and the reproducibility of the method is therefore established. In addition, the catalytic activity is increased over that of the electrode material prepared according to the above-described method; this can be observed, for instance, from the current-voltage characteristics of the electrode materials. Furthermore, the silver content in the end product may be reduced, compared to the product of the above described method, which is important for reasons of economy. Finally, through the use of tungsten carbide as the starting material, it is also possible to conduct an intermediate check regarding the electrochemical activity of the product electrode material by determining the activity of the tungsten carbide so used.\nThe invention will be explained in further detail with reference to an example of an embodiment and FIG. 1, which figure illustrates current-voltage characteristics of electrodes containing electrode material prepared in accordance with the invention.\nTungsten carbide is prepared as follows: 250 g of tungstic acid (H2 WO4) in powder form are reduced in a quartz tube furnace in hydrogen flowing at approximately 100 liters/hour. The reduction takes place first at 540\u00b0C for 3 hours and subsequently at about 700\u00b0C for 2 hours. After the reduction is complete, the temperature is raised to about 860\u00b0C and the hydrogen is replaced by carbon monoxide flowing at about 200 liters/hour. The carburation is complete after about 4 hours. One obtains about 190 g of tungsten carbide with a mean grain size of less than 1 micron. In order to avoid oxidation (the tungsten carbide can be present as a pyrophorous powder), the material, which is cooled under a carbon monoxide atmosphere, can be suspended immediately in water. The tungsten carbide prepared in this manner is fabricated into a so-called supported electrode having a coating thickness of 20mg/cm2. In a standard half-cell operated at room temperature (about 22\u00b0C) with a hydrogen pressure of 30 N/cm2, a 2.5 m H2 SO4 electrolyte and a polarization of 200 mV, the current yield is 0.25 A/gram of electrode material and the current density is 5 mA/cm2.\nA solution of sodium metatungstate is prepared in the following manner. 250 g of sodium tungstate (Na2 WO4 . 2 H2 O) are dissolved in 2.5 liters of water and 700 g of tungstic acid (H2 WO4) are added to this solution, which is subsequently heated and maintained for 2 to 3 hours at its boiling point. After the residue, which consists essentially of unreacted tungstic acid, has settled the remaining clear solution of sodium metatungstate, is decanted; additional sodium metatungstate solution is obtained by centrifuging the residue and combined with the decanted solution. The combined solutions are reduced to about 20% of their volume in a sand bath at temperatures up to about 250\u00b0C, thereby producing an approximately 1.2 molar sodium tungstate solution.\nElectrode material containing silver and tungsten carbide is prepared as follows. 500 g of finely divided tungsten carbide (or an aqueous suspension with the corresponding content of tungsten carbide) are added to 540 ml of an approximately 1.2 molar solution of sodium metatungstate (Na2 O . 4 WO3). The suspension thereby obtained, while being stirred vigorously, is reacted dropwise with a solution of 434 g of silver nitrate in 300 ml of water at a temperature of about 80\u00b0C. A mixture of about 1100 g (after filtering and drying) tungsten carbide and silver metatungstate precipitates in the form of a dark gray precipitate.\n150 g of such dried mixture of tungsten carbide and silver metatungstate (gross composition: Ag2 O . 4 WO3 + 4 WC) are placed in a quartz tube and reduced in a tube furnace in a hydrogen stream flowing at the rate of about 100 liters/hour for 2 hours at a furnace temperature of about 540\u00b0C. After the reduction of the silver metatungstate to metallic silver and tungsten is complete, the temperature of the furnace is raised to about 840\u00b0C and the hydrogen replaced with carbon monoxide flowing at the rate of about 100 liters/hour. The carburizing of the metallic tungsten is complete after about 50 minutes. About 107 g of electrode material (Ag-WC) with a grain size in the range between 10 and 80 microns is produced.\nThe electrode material prepared in this manner is fabricated into a supported electrode having an electrode area of 12.5cm2. To this end, sufficient electrode material is deposited on a layer of asbestos paper, which may contain a binder, to furnish a coating of about 200 mg/cm2. The coating of electrode material is covered on the gas side with a carbon fabric which supports the coating and serves to make electrical contact. On the electrolyte side, the asbestos layer is supported by a perforated tantalum sheet.\nThe catalytic activity of such an electrode was tested in a half-cell arrangement, a gold sheet serving as the counterelectrode. An electrolyte of 2.5 m H2 SO4 was used as the electrolyte liquid; hydrogen at 20 N/cm2 served as the reaction gas. An Hg/Hg2 SO4 electrode in the same electrolyte was used as the reference electrode.\nThe results obtained in the investigations are depicted in FIG. 1 as current-voltage characteristics, current density in mA/cm2 versus the polarization (\u03b7) in mV, measured against the Hg/Hg2 SO4 reference electrode. The characteristics were obtained on electrodes with a coating thickness of 200 mg/cm2. The data for curve 11 was obtained at an electrolyte temperature of 22\u00b0C; the data for curves 12 and 13 at electrolyte temperatures of 50\u00b0C and 70\u00b0C, respectively.\nAs may be seen from curve 11, a current density of about 21 mA/cm2 is obtained with the electrode material prepared in accordance with the invention, with a coating of 200 mg/cm2, an operating pressure of 20 N/cm2, an electrolyte temperature of 22\u00b0C and with a polarization of 200 mV; from this, the calculated current yield is about 0.1 ampere per gram of catalytically active electrode material. Referred to the tungsten carbide content alone (the material contains about 10 weight % silver), the current yield is about 0.12 ampere/gram. An important advantage of the electrode material prepared in accordance with the invention, as compared to pure tungsten carbide, is that electrodes made with it are operable at a hydrogen pressure of 12 N/cm2, and attain their optimum performance characteristic at about 20 N/cm2 ; with pure tungsten carbide, an operating pressure of about 30 N/cm2 is required.\nThe attainable current density increases with increasing electrolyte temperature. With a polarization of 200 mV, the current density is about 55 mA/cm2 (curve 12) at an electrolyte temperature of 50\u00b0C and at an electrolyte temperature of 70\u00b0C, the current density attainable with the same polarization is about 115 mA/cm2 (curve 13).\nIn addition to fuel cells and storage cells, the electrode material prepared in accordance with the invention may also be employed in other electrochemical cells, particularly for electro-synthesis and electrolysis. If used in storage cells, the electro-catalyst prepared in accordance with the invention is particularly useful as the electrode material in the indicator and consumable electrodes in gastight storage cells, because in such cells provision must be made for preventing the gases which may be generated due to overcharging, and are generated during discharging, from exerting an excessively high pressure. In order to achieve this, the capacity of the positive electrode is, for instance, selected to be larger than that of the negative electrode, so that in case of overcharging, hydrogen develops first at the negative electrode (2 H2 O + 2 e- \u2192 H2 + 2 OH-). In principle, two means of prevention are known. First, a so-called consumable electrode may be incorporated into the storage cell, at which the hydrogen which may be generated is electrochemically reacted and is brought into solution again. Secondly, the storage cell may comprise a so-called indicator electrode which is catalytically active and sets up the reversible hydrogen potential under the action of hydrogen. This potential, which is measured against a reference electrode, may then be used as a control signal to terminate the charging process. The electrode material prepared in accordance with the invention can be used for both kinds of the auxiliary electrodes mentioned, i.e., the consumable electrodes and the indicator electrodes.\n", "claims": "\nHaving thus described the invention, what is claimed is:\n \n1.

No. 3,884,216, both filed together herewith on Sept. 19, 1974.\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\nThe present invention relates to electrochemical means for producing heat and/or hydrogen gas, and more particularly to a simple, reliable, efficient and compact means for producing heat and/or hydrogen gas for use in remote areas. For example: the present invention may be used for replacing lost body heat for undersea divers or combat troops; it can be used for heating machinery or instruments in remote or cold areas; it may also be used for production of electrical or mechanical energy through use of a heat or expansion engine in remote locations; and, hydrogen produced thereby can be used for buoyancy in deep sea recovery operations or for production of energy by use of fuel cell type systems.\nThe electrochemical reaction between active metals such as magnesium and passive metals such as iron when immersed in electrolyte has been proposed for use as a heat source. Other systems advocate the use of massive plates of magnesium and iron (two-plate system) separated by an electrode gap, electrically shorted together and immersed in seawater. Such arrangement results in complex control problems and requires the use of large plate surface areas which result in bulky cumbersome apparatus. The arrangement is not adaptable to direct production of localized heat, thus the diver must carry a single bulky reaction chamber which can greatly restrict his maneuverability and reduce his effectiveness. In the two-plate system, heat production effectiveness is reduced because of operational problems associated with disposal of reaction products, magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. Volumes of hydrogen produced requires a large gas collection area to prevent dewatering of heat producing plates. Removal of hydrogen from the reaction chamber of a diver heater is complicated because of changing orientation of the diver. Production of magnesium hydroxide tends to clog the reaction area between plates, thus reducing power output. Reaction control is difficult and complicated because of continual depletion of active metal and the subsequent increasing electrode gap.\nPrevious methods used to produce hydrogen gas for deep sea buoyancy operations use exotic, expensive and hazardous chemicals which are recently becoming unavailable. For example, the use of hydrazine is presently being developed. Hydrazine requires complex control systems for ocean operations. Hydrazine is toxic, a moderate fire hazard and potentially explosive.\nPast proposals for the use of metallic elements for generation of hydrogen for buoyancy have been neglected because of the relatively slow reaction rate of metals with seawater. Coupling active metals with a passive metal increases this rate over 100 fold. By the use of the micro electrochemical cells described herein, another order of magnitude increase in reaction rate can be achieved for use in generating hydrogen.\nSUMMARY\nIt is not necessary to construct a battery of parallel plates to react magnesium with seawater. When magnesium and iron are fastened together in intimate contact and immersed in seawater, a galvanic couple is formed. Under such conditions, the magnesium corrodes at a greatly accelerated rate. The reaction is exothermic. It is shown by the present invention that a mixture of finely divided iron and magnesium powders which have been ground into a composite material in a ball mill, or the like, can be reacted rapidly with seawater to serve as a heat source for divers, etc.\nOBJECTS OF THE INVENTION\nIt is an object of the invention, therefore, to provide a heat source comprising micro electrochemical cells.\nAnother object is to provide micro electrochemical cells utilizing an intimate mixture of active and passive metals for producing heat and hydrogen.\nStill another object is to provide an intimate mixture of active and passive powdered metals for the rapid production of heat and hydrogen in electrolyte.\nA further object is to provide a heat source using micro electrochemical cells for warming various parts of the human body.\nOther objects, advantages and novel features of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\nFIG. 1 is an idealized illustration of a micro electrochemical cell formed from ironized magnesium.\nFIG. 2 illustrates a pellet prepared by compressing mixtures of powdered magnesium and iron or ironized magnesium.\nFIG. 3 is a curve showing the evolution of hydrogen by reaction of finely divided magnesium and magnesium/iron with seawater electrolyte.\nFIG. 4 is an embodiment of the invention illustrating in cross-section the structure of an exothermic material or blanket using micro electrochemical cells.\nFIG. 5 shows in cross-section another embodiment of a flexible heating material using micro electrochemical cells.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT\nThe system for producing heat and hydrogen as described herein utilizes an intimate mixture of active and passive metals (e.g. magnesium and iron) to form micro electrochemical cells. It is of primary importance that the active and passive metals be mixed so that the electrical contact resistance between them is very low. This degree of mixing is achieved by the use of a ball mill apparatus. Iron and magnesium particles placed in a ball mill with an inert solvent and ground together causes iron particles to become embedded on the magnesium particles. The combination of iron particles embedded on a magnesium particle forms a miniature electrochemical cell, such as shown in FIG. 1, which when placed in an electrolyte produces heat and hydrogen gas. In the case of a diver heater, the electrolyte selected is seawater because of safety, reliability and abundant supply. With the seawater electrolyte, heat is produced from the exothermic formation of Mg(OH)2. Theoretically, 3.47 calories and 1 ml of hydrogen are produced for every mg of magnesium reacted at 23.7\u00b0 C.\nThe reaction which occurs in the micro cells is essentially the same nature as that of a massive two-plate cell. However, with the micro cell arrangement larger exposed surface areas of active metal are available which allow the reaction to proceed at much high rates. Variations of powder size and the ratio of active to passive metal surface area can be used to produce an infinite variety of heat sources capable of providing energy for seconds, hours, days, weeks, or years of operational life. Pressing the mixture together can provide a single plate heat or hydrogen producing cell, and sintering the mixtures can extend the duration of a particular mixture. The final form of the micro cell power source will be dependent on the application. For example, the powdered form of the micro cells allows the heat or hydrogen source to be flexible and conform to contours such as diver's hand or the foot of a hiker or combatant soldier. In powdered form, a slurry of active and passive metals can be metered into a reactive chamber to produce a variable controlled reaction rate. In pressed and/or sintered form, the single plate cell may be formed into a rigid shape with a predetermined reaction rate. Sodium chloride particles may be interdispersed in the cell matricies so that the simple addition of water will activate the reaction. Numerous material combinations are available utilizing other active and passive metals together with binders additions of trace elements such as mercury, etc., and a variety of electrolytes depending on the particular application.\nThe present system of utilizing electrochemical reactions to produce heat and hydrogen has many advantages, such as:\na. Simplicity of design. The use of micro cells lends itself to simplified reaction control over previous methods by selection of material size, binders, trace additives, extent of intimate contact, sintering or pressing. Metering of electrolyte or metal slurry into a reactor chamber can be used for reaction control.\nb. Larger available surface area in comparison to any previous method affords compact lighter weight design.\nc. Ease of manufacture. Simply grinding the powdered metals in a ball mill produces a heat or hydrogen generating cell. End products are simply measured into a single reaction chamber e.g. (canister) to provide a desired output.\nd. Formability. This mew method lends itself to a variety of different sizes and shapes. For example, the powdered micro cells can be packed around any object to be heated, thus conforming to the shape of the object. Simply adding salt water activates the process.\ne. Long shelf life and ease of storage. The premixed micro cells may be stored indefinitely in evacuated plastic bags or jars or in an inert atmosphere. Simply opening the container and adding salt water will activate the reaction.\nf. Extended duration appliations. In cases where long operational periods are required, the material can be premixed to provide the desired results.\ng. Single cell construction. The previous methods require the use of two preassembled plates which require an electrode gap. This new method provides the electrochemical cell in a single plate or powdered form which is especially adaptable to use in remote areas where space and ease of transportation and portability is essential.\nThe present invention is intended to cover all combinations of active and passive materials intimately mixed together to form micro electrochemical cells. All powder particles sizes, mixing methods, additives and aggregations of mixed particles into larger groups are considered as extensions of this basic concept described herein.\nExperimental investigation into the use of a powdered metal source for the production of heat and hydrogen gas is discussed below.\nMeasurements of the cumulative volumes of hydrogen evolved by the reaction of magnesium with seawater were made periodically by collecting the hydrogen over water in inverted graduated cylinders.\nSimultaneous measurements of the heat liberated and hydrogen evolved were also made.\nFinely divided magnesium of different particle sizes was employed: magnesium turnings, a coarse magnesium powder, and a very fine magnesium powder. The coarse powder passed a U.S. Standard Sieve (ASTM Specification) No. 30 (openings of 590 microns) but was stopped by a Sieve No. 50 (openings of 297 microns). The fine powder consisted of a mixture, all of which passed U.S. Standard Sieve No. 100 (openings of 149 microns) but only approximately half of which passed Sieve No. 200 (openings of 74 microns). An analytical-grade iron powder which passed the U.S. Standard Sieve No. 200 was also used for some of the experiments.\nMeasurements were made of the maximum volumes of hydrogen liberated from magnesium of the three particle sizes by reaction with an excess of dilute hydrochloric acid. Results for half-gram samples at 24\u00b0 C were as follows:\n\n Calculated              501 mlTurnings                480 mlCoarse Powder           490 mlFine Powder             330 ml\nThe fine powder was not pure and apparently contained only about 66% of free magnesium.\nReaction of finely divided magnesium with seawater:\nA one-half gram sample and a one-gram sample of coarse magnesium powder were each reacted with 25-ml portions of seawater at 68\u00b0 C. Although both samples reacted slowly, the evolution of hydrogen was measurable. It was twice as rapid from the one-gram sample as from the 1/2 gram sample.\nOne-half gram samples of finely divided magnesium of the three previously described particle sizes were reacted with 25-ml portions of seawater at 68\u00b0 C. The magnesium turnings liberated hydrogen at the slowest rate; the coarse powder, at an intermediate rate; and the fine powder at the fastest rate during the first part of the experiment. However, the rate of evolution of hydrogen from the fine powder slowed down abruptly and all but ceased when only about one-half of the magnesium had reacted.\nOne-half gram samples of magnesium of each of the three particle sizes were then mixed with equal weights of fine iron powder. The mixtures were covered with seawater and permitted to react. The reaction flasks were again immersed in a water bath maintained at 68\u00b0 C. The rates of evolution of hydrogen from all three mixtures were approximately double the rates in the previous tests in which iron powder had not been added.\nTwenty-five gram samples of magnesium of each of the three particle sizes were then \"ironized.\" In this process, the magnesium samples were mixed with equal weights of iron powder, placed in ball mill jars, covered with an inert solvent (1, 1, 1-trichloroethane), and then ground together on the ball mill for 16 hours. The solvent was evaporated and, when dry, the magnesium turnings were separated from most of the iron powder by sifting. A little of the iron powder remained embedded in the magnesium turnings. Similarly, the coarse magnesium powder was separated from the fine iron powder by sifting. The fine magnesium powder and the fine iron powder were both approximately the same size and could not be conveniently separated by sifting so they were permitted to remain as a mixture.\nOne-half gram samples of the ironized magnesium turnings and ironized coarse magnesium powder and a one-gram sample of the mixed fine powder of iron and ironized magnesium were each covered with 25 ml of seawater and permitted to react. As before, the reaction mixtures were maintained at 68\u00b0 C. In all three cases the rates of evolution of hydrogen were nearly 50 times greater than the rates had been from the simple mixtures of iron and magnesium.\nThe evolution of hydrogen from various magnesium samples was plotted (FIG. 2) against time on a simple linear scale. By inspection of the curves, it was possible to estimate the times required for 25% and 50% of the magnesium to be consumed. These values were based on the volumes of hydrogen evolved relative to the volumes evolved when similar samples of magnesium were treated with dilute hydrochloric acid. The values are useful for comparing the reactivities of the various samples of magnesium. They are given in Table 1 and are referred to as the quarter-lives and half-lives for the various materials.\nLater, another batch of the ironized magnesium was prepared from the coarse magnesium powder and fine iron powder. The second batch turned out to be more reactive than the first and reacted with seawater nearly 20 times more rapidly than the first batch. The half-lives were approximately 4 and 1/4 hour, respectively, for the first and second batches. The second batch, which was larger than the first, was employed in the ensuing experiments.\n\n               TABLE 1______________________________________Estimated quarter-lives (t1/4) andhalf-lives (t1/2), in hours, forvarious magnesium samples in sea-water at 68\u00b0C.

A comparison was made of the reaction rates of the pelletized and unpelletized ironized magnesium powder. For the test, a pellet was sawed in two and each half was trimmed to a weight of one-half gram. The experiment was conducted in duplicate. Two 1/2-gram samples of the unpelletized powder and two 1/2-gram segments of the pellets were used. The pelletized samples reacted a little more slowly than the unpelletized powder, especially during the first half hour. They also reacted at a little more uniform rate than the unpelletized powder which reacted at a very rapid initial, but steadily declining rate.\nPellets were also made from simple mixtures of iron and magnesium. Each of the pellets contained 1 gram of the coarse magnesium powder. One of the pellets also contained 500 mg of fine iron powder; the second contained 50 mg of iron powder; and the third contained no iron powder. The pellets were reacted with 50 ml of seawater maintained at 68\u00b0 C. The cumulative volumes of hydrogen evolved in the reactions were measured periodically. Hydrogen was produced most rapidly by the pellets containing the greatest amount of iron and the least rapidly by the pellets to which no iron had been added.\nEffect of temperature on reaction rates:\nThe effect of temperature on reaction rates was investigated. The experiments were conducted in the same manner as the other experiments with the exceptions that an ice bath and a room temperature bath were employed in addition to a 68\u00b0 C bath. In the first experiment on temperature effects, ironized powdered magnesium was employed. In the second experiment, tests were made with pelletized ironized magnesium. Duplicate determinations were made for each material for each of the temperatures: 0\u00b0 C, 24\u00b0 C, and 68\u00b0 C.\nIn all tests the initial reaction rates were fastest at 68\u00b0 C, slowest at 0\u00b0 C, and intermediate at 24\u00b0 C. However, the rates all declined steadily. the decline occurred most rapidly in those maintained at 68\u00b0 C; next, for those maintained at 24\u00b0 C; and slowest, for those maintained at 0\u00b0 C. The decline at 24\u00b0 C was only slightly greater than the decline at 0\u00b0 C, but the decline at 68\u00b0 C was considerably greater. In about 400 minutes when the experiment was terminated, the cumulative volume of hydrogen liberated from the reaction maintained at 0\u00b0 C was the greatest, indicating that hydrogen was generated fastest at 0\u00b0 C. The volume liberated by the reaction at 24\u00b0 C was nearly as great; but the volume liberated by the reaction at 68\u00b0 C was merely 60% of the volume at 0\u00b0 C.\nMeasurements of the Production of Heat:\nSimultaneous measurements of the liberation of heat and evolution of hydrogen were made. Seven 1/2-gram samples of unpelletized powdered ironized magnesium were reacted with seawater. The volumes of seawater employed in the measurements were 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 ml. The test results up to the times that the temperatures attained maximum values are summarized in Table 2.\nThe \"dry\" heat cell:\nAn experiment was performed to see if the reaction could be controlled by the regulated addition of seawater to the dry ironized magnesium. One-half gram of ironized magnesium powder was placed in a dry test tube which was rested on the bottom of the dewar flask. Fifty ml of seawater was added to the flask. The water surrounded the bottom half of the test tube to serve as a heat sink but none was permitted to enter it. The test tube was so positioned in the dewar that the tip of the dropping burette was over the top of the test tube. Via the burette, 0.2 ml of seawater was added to the ironized magnesium powder initially and an additional 0.2 was added every 10 minutes until a total of 2 ml had been added. In 35 minutes the temperature rose from 25\u00b0 C to 33\u00b0 C and it was maintained at 33\u00b0 - 35\u00b0 C for the ensuing 21/2 hours.\n\n               TABLE 2______________________________________Comparisons of hydrogen evolved and heats liberatedby the reaction of ironized magnesium with variousvolumes of seawater.             \u0394H  Volume of             Calculated                       Hydrogen                               \u0394H*Volume of   Maximum   From Rise Evolved up                               CalculatedSeawater   Rise in   in Temp.  to time from Volume(ml)    Temp.

The flask contained the same amount of seawater and the same test tube, but the ironized magnesium powder was immediately mixed with the entire 52 ml of seawater. In this reaction the temperature rose to nearly 40\u00b0 C in less than one hour but fell more rapidly than in the previous reaction in which the water addition was controlled.\nSome crude measurements were made of the space occupied by the initial and final products when ironized magnesium powder is reacted with the minimum volume of seawater. A 25 ml volumetric flask was weighed and then filled with ironized magnesium powder. The weight of the powder was 24.7 gm. That is, the density of the loosely packed dry powder is approximately 1 gm per ml. A 2-ml microbeaker graduated in 1/2-ml increments was filled to the first 1/2-ml mark with dry ironized magnesium powder. The powder was slowly reacted with a very slight excess of seawater. During the reaction, the magnesium granules increased in size and changed color from silver to off-white. The volume occupied by the dried loosely packed magnesium hydroxide granules was 11/2 ml, three times the original volume. Stoichiometry of reaction of magnesium and seawater:\nThe overall reaction of magnesium with seawater can be represented by the equation:\n\n Mg + 2 H.sub.2 O\u2192Mg (OH).sub.2 + H.sub.2 + \u0394 h\nwhere \u0394h = heat of the reaction.\nThe theoretical amount of heat evolved in the same equation is 84.36 kilogram calories per gram molecular weight of magnesium at a constant temperature of 25\u00b0 C (-221.00 + 2 \u00d7 68.32 = -84.36). This value would ordinarily be corrected for the energy consumed in expanding the hydrogen. At atmospheric pressure, this correction would be approximately 0.6 kilogram calories per mole of magnesium. At ocean depths where the hydrostatic pressure is 10 atmospheres, the correction would be a mere 0.06 kilogram calories per mole. Disregarding these corrections, the calculated values for the heat liberated is 3,470 calories per gram or 1,830 watt hours per pound.\nThe theoretical volumes of hydrogen liberated in the reaction of magnesium with seawater is 1.007 ml per mg at 250\u00b0 C (1.000 ml at 23.7\u00b0 C). This is equivalent to 16.1 cubic feet of hydrogen per pound of magnesium at 25\u00b0 C. When the volume of hydrogen is measured at 23.7\u00b0 C, there are 3.47 calories liberated for each ml of hydrogen evolved.\nReaction of finely divided magnesium with seawater:\nFrom Table 1, it is apparent that the speed of reaction of various forms of magnesium with seawater ranges from those that react too slowly to serve as a heat source for divers to those that react too rapidly. One can prepare a magnesium specimen that will react very slowly and require months to be consumed, or one can prepare a specimen that will react suddenly and be consumed in a few seconds.\nThe experiments with the various magnesium and iron powders disclosed that, with other factors being constant, the rate of evolution of hydrogen, and hence the rate of liberation of heat, is related to the surface area of the magnesium reacting with the seawater. For example, the most finely divided magnesium powders reacted the most rapidly; the coarse powders, at an intermediate rate; and the turnings, at the slowest rate. Also, hydrogen was evolved from 1 gm of coarse magnesium powder in seawater at approximately twice the rate that it was liberated from 1/2 gm of the same powder in seawater. The surface area of the 1-gm sample of magnesium powder would be twice that of the 1/2-gm sample. Both findings strengthen the conclusion that the rate of the reaction of magnesium with seawater is a function of the surface area of the magnesium.\nAnother important factor determining the rate of reaction of magnesium with seawater is the intimacy of contact of the magnesium with iron. When no iron was presumed to be present, magnesium turnings and powders reacted with seawater but the rate was too slow to be considered as a potential source of heat for divers. Merely mixing finely divided magnesium samples with iron powder caused them to react with seawater twice as rapidly. However, the speed of the reaction was still too slow to serve as a potential heat source for divers. Grinding mixtures of iron and magnesium turnings and powders together in a ball mill jar produced a composite material consisting of magnesium particles into which iron particles were embedded. The ironized magnesium reacted with seawater 50 times or so more rapidly than the simple mixture of iron and magnesium. The reaction rates of the ironized materials were sufficiently rapid to be considered as sources of heat for divers.\nThe speed of reaction of a shunted magnesium-iron seawater battery is a function of the area of the iron plate in electrical contact with magnesium. The ironized magnesium is in essence a collection of tiny shunted magnesium-iron seawater batteries. Therefore, the area of the iron particles in electrical contact with the magnesium particles also is a factor determining the reactivity of ironized magnesium and seawater.\nReaction of pelletized magnesium powder with seawater:\nThere was no striking difference in the reactivities of pelletized and unpelletized ironized magnesium powder. The pellets reacted at a little slower rate than the unpelletized material during the first half hour of the experiment, but they reacted more rapidly in the ensuing time intervals.\nThe reactivity of pellets made from simple mixtures of iron and magnesium was a function of the amount of iron they contained. Hydrogen was evolved most rapidly from the pellets to which the greatest amount of iron powder had been added, and the least rapidly by the pellets to which no iron powder had been added. Intimate galvanic contact between the iron and magnesium was apparently achieved by the compressing process. It was not necessary to first ironize the magnesium in a ball mill jar.\nPelletizing magnesium and iron powders apparently affected their reactivity with seawater in two ways. Compressing the mixture of iron and magnesium powders brought iron and magnesium particles into more intimate contact, thereby causing the product to react more readily than the initial mixture. Compressing the ironized magnesium powder did not significantly alter the proximity of the magnesium and iron particles to each other. They were already in intimate contact. The compression process did, however, at least partially fuse the magnesium and iron particles into a solid pellet. Seawater had access only to the outside of the pellet when it was immersed. After the pellet reacted a little, however, it crumbled and reacted at a slightly more rapid rate than the unpelletized material.\nA material more thoroughly fused than the pellets, which were compressed at 37,500 psi, should react at a more uniform rate throughout its existence in seawater. Reaction rates thus can be controlled by the area of the surface of the pellets. The area will change slowly if the pellets do not crumble and the reaction will proceed at a nearly uniform rate. More thorough fusion can be achieved by higher pressures and temperatures than have been used. Addition of other materials that are soft, malleable, and highly conductive can also be considered as a means for achieving fusion.\nMeasurements of the production of heat:\nThe calculated heat of reaction for the complete reaction of one-half gram of magnesium with seawater is 1,735 calories at 25\u00b0 C. However, as seen in Table 2, the calculated heat corresponding to the volume of hydrogen evolved up to the time that the maximum temperature was reached was in the vicinity of 1,250 calories. The measured calories approached the calculated as the volume of water was increased. This was to be expected because temperature rise and the heat loss become smaller as the volume of water is made larger.\nThe rises in temperature were of a range of magnitudes expected for the theoretical amount of heat liberated. The rises were in a range consistent with the classical thermodynamic statement for the reaction of magnesium and water represented by the equation:\n\n Mg + 2 H.sub.2 O\u2192Mg (OH).sub.2 + H.sub.2 + \u0394 h\nwhere \u0394h = 3.57 calories per mg of magnesium or 1,830 watt-hours per pound of magnesium\nThe \"dry\" magnesium heat cell:\nA heat cell can be made with the dry ironized magnesium powder to which a limited amount of seawater is added for activation. Heat will be liberated whenever seawater is injected into the charge of ironized magnesium powder. If NaCl is mixed with the dry ironized magnesium powder, only water need be added.\nIn another experiment, water addition did control the rate of the reaction somewhat for the first half hour. After that, however, sufficient water was present to decompose all of the magnesium. Temperature curves indicated that less heat was produced per given weight of ironized magnesium when the seawater was admitted slowly, as in the dry heat cell, than when an abundance of seawater was added immediately.\nThe dry heat cell has numerous desirable features. It is simple to operate and regulate. The diver can admit water to the cell whenever he feels cold and the response will be quite rapid. It is not necessary to use up all of the ironized magnesium in a single dive. The cell will soon cease to react if water is cut off. The size of the cell can easily be scaled up or down. Tiny cylinders can be made to fit into the finger holes of gloves; medium sized cylinders would be made for short dives; or large cylinders could be made for extended dives. Interchangeable cylinders charged with ironized magnesium could be made to fit into a water jacket which surrounds the cylinders. Only one pump is required to conduct the heat exchanger fluid to the diver.\nIn the \"dry cell\" experiment, approximately 350 ml of hydrogen were evolved from 500 mg of ironized magnesium. Calculations based on 350 ml of hydrogen indicate that approximately 2,500 calories will be liberated per gram of ironized magnesium. A charge of 344 grams of ironized magnesium are required for a one-kilowatt-hour (kwh) cell. Initially this would occupy about one-third of a liter of space. After reacting with approximately 500 ml of seawater, the magnesium would swell to completely occupy a one-liter container. A cylinder the size of a standard scuba tank will hold a 14-kwh cell, and can be initially charged with nearly 5 kilograms of ironized magnesium powder. It requires a minimum of 7 liters of seawater for complete reaction. During the reaction, 3,700 liters of hydrogen will be evolved.\nFrom the above experimental investigation, it has been determined that:\nMagnesium alone reacts spontaneously with seawater but the rate is far too slow to use as a heat source for divers.\nHydrogen is evolved and heat is produced at a rate which is approximately proportional to the surface area of magnesium reacting with seawater. The surface area depends upon the weight of magnesium and the particle size.\nMerely mixing iron powder with finely divided magnesium causes magnesium to react with seawater twice as rapidly as before mixing.\nGrinding iron and magnesium powders or turnings together in a ball mill jar produces a material which reacts with seawater nearly 100 times more rapidly than pure magnesium powders.\nCompressing iron and magnesium powders together under a pressure of 37,500 psi produces pellets which react with seawater many times more rapidly than pure magnesium powder. The reaction rates are a function of the amount of iron powder the pellets contain.\nIronized magnesium powder initially reacts very rapidly with seawater and slows down rather abruptly as the reaction proceeds. Pelletized ironized magnesium reacts with a somewhat more uniform rate and does not undergo an initial spurt in activity.\nThe initial rate of reaction of magnesium and seawater is a function of temperature. The higher the temperature is, the more rapid the initial reaction.\nOnce the initial high velocity reactions have subsided, less hydrogen and presumably less heat is evolved by the reaction of magnesium and seawater at 68\u00b0 C than at 0\u00b0 C or at 24\u00b0 C.\nThe experimental measurements of the liberation of heat by the reaction of magnesium and seawater are in a range to be consistent with a theoretical heat of reaction of 84.36 kilogram calories per mole of magnesium.\nThe reaction of ironized magnesium and seawater can be regulated by the controlled addition of seawater.\nThe space required for a 1-kwh heat cell charged with dry ironized magnesium is 1 liter.\nFinely divided iron and magnesium can be made into a composite material sufficiently reactive with seawater to serve as a heat source. One manner in which the reaction can be controlled is to control the addition of seawater, adding water only when more heat is desired.\nAnother use for the powdered metal heat source of this invention is in the making of a material, such as shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, which have a large variety of applications. For example, such heating materials can be used for gloves, socks, boot liners, foot pads and other garments for warming various parts of the body, as well as for medical heat pads, warmers for food cans, and sleeping bag heaters to provide a thermal barrier between the sleeping bag and cold ground, and the like.\nAs shown in the embodiment of FIG. 4, by way of example, ironized magnesium particles 40 are sandwiched together with an absorbent material 41 which retains moisture, between two flexible sheets of thin plastic material 42 and 43, such as mylar or polysulfonates, for example. Plastic sheet 43 is provided with an adhesive layer 45 which holds the ironized magnesium particles 40 in place. Plastic sheet 42 can also be provided with an adhesive layer 46 for adhering to the absorbent material 41. Sodium chloride particles 47 can be mixed with either the absorbent material 41 or the ironized magnesium particles 40, or both, as desired. Holes 48 are provided in plastic sheet 42 to admit water which dissolves the sodium chloride and activates the micro electrochemical cells 40. Holes may be provided in both sheets of plastic material 42 and 43, if desired, for faster introduction of water. Where seawater is introduced via holes 48, the sodium chloride particles 47 would not need to be provided in the absorbent material 41 or mixed with the magnesium and iron particles.\nThe embodiment illustrated in FIG. 5 shows a mixture of ironized magnesium particles 40, adhesive 51 and absorbent material 52 all sandwiched between plastic sheets 53 and 54. The adhesive particles 51 bond the ironized magnesium particles and absorbent material together and to plastic sheets 53 and 54. Holes 58 are provided for admitting seawater to start the exothermic reaction. If desired, sodium chloride particles can be mixed with the ironized magnesium particles 40, adhesive 51 and absorbent material 52, thus only requiring plain water to be introduced for starting the reaction. Powdered iron and powdered magnesium can be used instead of ironized magnesium particles in either of the embodiments shown in FIGS. 4 and 5 where a slower reaction is desired.\nObviously many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.\n", "claims": "\nWe claim:\n \n1.

L. Dudley in 18 J. Am. Chem Soc. 901. Dudley fused sodium dioxide in a nickel crucible with nickel metal at a cherry-red heat, about 700\u00b0-800\u00b0C, for about one hour. After cooling, the contents were submerged in water. The formed brown crystals were then washed to remove alkali. The crystals were then dried at 110\u00b0C. The crystals were analyzed and believed to be the dihydrate Ni3 O4 . 2H2 O, with 0.7 wt% cobalt as an impurity. A cobaltocobaltic dihydrate Co3 O4 . 2H2 O is also described as obtained by exposing to moist air Co3 O4, prepared by heating cobalt carbonate. These materials were believed to be new compounds but no active battery material or electrochemical use was suggested.\nPresently used methods for the preparation of nickel active battery material involve chemical precipitation or electrochemical precipitation of divalent nickel (II) hydroxide, as taught for example by Feduska et. al. in U.S. Pat. No. 3,579,385 and Hardman in U.S. Pat. No. 3,600,227. Faber, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,436,267, converted directly to trivalent Ni (III) hydroxide battery material, by 100% oxidation of finely divided Ni (II) hydroxide powder in a gas stream containing ozone. He then pasted this material into an electrode plaque.\nThe usual procedure in making a battery plate involves loading the divalent nickel (II) hydroxide into a porous plaque, with oxidation of the material in the plaque to a form of trivalent nickel (III) hydroxide. This is accomplished by electrochemical charging and discharging \"formation\" of the loaded plaque in an alkaline electrolyte, prior to introduction of the plaque into a battery.\nOzone treatment involves a complex process using expensive equipment. Electro-precipitation processes are also costly and represent a disproportionate share of the raw materials expense in iron-nickel batteries, while chemical precipitation methods result in gelatinous materials which are difficult to load into a conducting matrix.\nAll three of these methods involve initial production of nickel hydroxide. Chemical precipitation means high cost starting materials, precipitation, filtering, washing, drying, grinding, etc., all of which make the cost of the final electrode powder high. Electro-precipitation and ozone treatment involve major capital expenditures for hardware in addition to high costs for starting materials.\nWith the increasing importance of improved batteries as a clean power source, especially in the transportation area, there is a need for improved active materials, that will provide capacities closer to the theoretical limit than heretofore possible. To make these batteries commercially feasible, the costs of active material manufacture must be drastically reduced. What is needed then is a method of making inexpensive highly active materials.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nWe have discovered a process that will provide an improved activated battery material mixture, by chemically reacting NiO, which may also have added to it about 2-12 wt% Co based on NiO plus Co content as a material selected from Co, CoO, Co2 O3, Co3 O4, or their mixtures, with effective amounts of Na2 O2, generally within a weight ratio of Nio:Na2 O2 of 1:1.35 to 1:2.1. This nickel oxide-sodium peroxide mixture is reacted at temperatures between about 800\u00b0C-1150\u00b0C, for a period of time, generally about 1/2 - 8 hours, effective to form NaNiO2 or NaNiO2 plus NaCoO2 melted reaction product.\nThe reaction product, comprising NaNiO2, is then hydrolyzed. If the cobalt oxide or elemental cobalt additive was not added initially, before fusion, as is preferred, it will be added generally as cobalt hydroxide after hydrolysis, or as a water soluble cobalt salt such as cobalt chloride or cobalt nitrate during hydrolysis, after hydrolysis or after plaque loading.\nThis process will provide a final solid active battery material containing over about 95 wt% solid Ni hydrated oxides and hydroxide forms and Co hydroxide forms, the remainder being interlaminar sodium. It is important that about 0.5 to 5 wt% but preferably 0.5 to 3 wt% unreacted NaNiO2 be present after hydrolysis and drying. The unreacted NaNiO2 is present, in the active material as interlaminar sodium in the nickel oxy-hydroxide layers and helps prevent swelling of the active material in the plate during the life of the battery.\nThis activated battery material is washed and generally dried after which it can then be loaded into a supporting porous plaque to provide an electrode plate, which may then be electrochemically cycled or \"formed\" (electrically charged and discharged in an alkaline electrolyte) prior to use in a battery opposite a suitable negative electrode. The drying step is generally carried out at temperatures below about 65\u00b0C, or at a suitable temperature in a high moisture atmosphere so that water present in the active material structure is not eliminated to an extent to cause the material to lose activity.\nThis process involves conversion of nickel oxide, or nickel oxide with added cobalt as elemental cobalt or cobalt oxide to an active battery material powder without tedious filtering or washing steps and without use of expensive electrical equipment. The starting materials cost is significantly reduced, since nickel oxide is the least expensive nickel containing material commercially available. Starting with nickel oxide makes the process useful and commercially feasible, since it eliminates a prolonged oxidation step at high temperatures which is sure to degrade the reaction container. Starting materials cost relative to the chemical, electrochemical and ozone processes is drastically reduced by at least 50%. In addition, a by-product of this process is an aqueous alkali metal hydroxide solution which may be further used as a battery electrolyte by suitable processing, or used as a basic material for neutralizing mine acid pools and the like.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\nFor a better understanding of the invention, reference may be made to the preferred embodiments exemplary of the invention, shown in the accompanying drawings in which:\nFIG. 1 is a graph showing the performance of the three Example 1 nickel electrode plates, in terms of capacity versus cycle number, in relation to the theoretical capacity value;\nFIG. 2 is a graph showing the effect of NiO + CoO + Na2 O2 reaction time on the performance of nickel electrode plates;\nFIG. 3 is a graph showing the effect of NiO + CoO + Na2 O2 reaction temperature on the performance of nickel electrode plates;\nFIG. 4 is a graph showing the effect of the weight ratio NiO:Na.sub. 2 O2 on the performance of nickel electrode plates;\nFIG. 5 is a graph showing the effect of the cobalt concentration on the performance of nickel electrode plates; and,\nFIG. 6 shows a preferred electrode plaque loaded with the active battery material of this invention.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\nOne embodiment of a battery, utilizing the improved active material and electrode plate of the invention, would generally comprise a plurality of alternate positive nickel plates and negative plates such as, for example, loaded iron active material plates. This stack up would contain plate separators between the positive and negative plates, all contacted by alkaline electrolyte and housed in a case having a cover, a vent, and positive and negative terminals.\nPreferred electrode plaques, shown in FIG. 6, are made from metal fibers, preferably nickel, or metal protective coated fibers, such as nickel coated steel or iron. A very suitable material is nickel coated steel wool. The plaque 10, is a flexible, expansible, compacted sheet of relatively smooth, generally contacting, intermingled, metal fibers as shown at 11 in the body of the plaque. The plaque has, in the embodiment shown, top edge 12 coined to a high density. The coined area provides a base to which lead tab 13, which is attached to battery terminals, is spot welded. The plaque is generally between about 90 and 95% porous. This range is preferable in providing improved conductivity and electrolyte permeability, while maintaining enough body for good plaque loading. Activated nickel electrode material is loaded into the interstices of the body of this fibrous plaque to provide an electrode plate. This invention, however, is not restricted to the preferred plaque structure described herein, and the active material can be used with other metallic plaque structures.\nThe metal fibers are preferably diffusion bonded in a protective atmosphere at temperatures up to the sintering point of the fibers used. In diffusion bonding, the fibers must not be melted, or protuberances will be formed reducing active material loading (volume) within the plaque. There should only be a metallurgical bond and interdiffusion of atoms across the fiber interface at fiber contact points 14 along the fiber lengths. Diffusion bonding provides a flexible, expansible electrode structure having a large pore volume into which active material can be pasted or otherwise impregnated. Diffusion bonding also lowers the electrode plate resistance appreciably and thus the internal cell resistance in a finished cell.\nThe active material is prepared by mixing the nickel oxide with sodium peroxide and then heating the nickel oxide (NiO) and sodium peroxide (Na2 O2). These materials are generally in powdered or particulate form. The starting material preferably contains between about 2-12 wt% cobalt, based on Ni plus Co, added as elemental cobalt or preferably as a cobalt oxide such as Co2 O3, Co3 O4, CoO or their mixtures. These reactants are preferred to be of moderate to high purity. They are fused and melted, generally in a suitable high temperature resistant container, for example a nickel crucible, in an oxidizing or inert atmosphere, in an oven maintained at a temperature of between about 800\u00b0-1150\u00b0C, for about 1/2 - 8 hours. It is essential in terms of a commercial process to use the oxidized nickel (NiO) as starting material, since otherwise long oxidation of Ni to NiO will seriously degrade and ruin the expensive reaction container.\nIn the reaction, the sodium peroxide decomposes to form Na2 O which oxidizes the NiO. We have found, unexpectedly, that a high capacity, easily pasteable active battery material is formed when the reaction product is then hydrolyzed, generally by immersion in water, to cause a decomposition reaction and formation of Ni hydrated oxides and Ni hydroxide forms and cobalt hydroxide. The active material is generally washed until neutral to litmus and then may be dried at a temperature that will not degrade activity, e.g., between about 15\u00b0C - 65\u00b0C. The NaOH formed could be drawn off in some continuous fashion and concentrated by evaporation, for example, into a saleable product.\nA set of equations which in part describes the basic preferred fusion and hydrolysis reactions can be given as: ##EQU1##\n\n 2NaNiO.sub.2 + NaCoO.sub.2 + 3H.sub.2 O \u2192 NI(OH).sub.2 + CoOOH + NiO.sub.2. (1-2)H.sub.2 O + 3NaOH\nWe found in accordance with the prior art that cobalt addition was necessary at some step in the method to provide an active material in the electrode plate which would have superior electrochemical performance, i.e., a capacity of about 0.185 amp-hours/gram active material, after 25 cycles.\nThe cobalt, in the form of elemental Co or cobalt oxide is added preferably before the fusion step, but cobalt additive may be added instead to the paste after the hydrolysis step, generally as cobalt hydroxide Co(OH)2, prior to incorporation into the plaque. When cobalt additive is added as elemental cobalt or as a cobalt oxide, before fusion, the active material contains cobalt (III) hydroxide; if added in a Co hydroxide form after hydrolysis, the active material contains cobalt (III) hydroxide. Cobalt hydroxide is expensive and when added after hydrolysis does not provide completely homogeneous mixing.\nGenerally the nickel hydrated oxides and hydroxide forms will be washed to remove most of the NaOH and the cobalt hydroxide may be added as an aqueous slurry; or the nickel material may be dried and the cobalt hydroxide mixed with it in a suitable mill or other type mixer. Also, during or after hydrolysis, aqueous cobalt chloride (Co(Cl)2 . (6H2 O) or cobalt nitrate (Co(NO3)2 . 6H2 O) additive may be used, in which case after reaction with alkaline hydroxide present or added, the final active material will contain cobalt (II) hydroxide, Co(OH)2. Addition of an appropriate amount of cobalt nitrate solution to the alkaline slurry after hydrolysis results in a fairly uniform dispersion of Co(OH)2 precipitate with the nickel active material.\nThe plaque can also be loaded with battery material not containing cobalt, and then dipped for an adequate period of time in aqueous cobalt nitrate or chloride solution, dried, and finally dipped in alkali hydroxide, such as KOH, NaOH or LiOH, to provide a precipitate of Co(OH)2 in the material. This would also provide a useful method to upgrade the cobalt content of loaded plaques.\nIn all cases, cobalt addition is preferred and the total weight percent of cobalt, as Co in the active material, must be between about 2 - 12 wt% and preferably about 5-8 wt% of the initial weight of NiO plus Co, i.e., wt% Co = Co/(NiO + Co) Cobalt concentration below 2 wt% and above 12 wt% detracted from acceptable performance. Failure to add cobalt to the plaque provided a plate having a capacity of about 0.10 amphr/g. A useful active material can be made without containing cobalt, but a plate containing such material, before being used in a battery, should be dipped in a cobalt solution to insure cobalt content and obtaining higher capacity.\nWe found that the weight ratio of NiO to Na2 O2 was critical in providing an electrode plate having acceptable electrochemical performance. The weight ratio of NiO:Na2 O2 must be between about 1:1.35 to about 1:2.1. An amount of Na2 O2 less than about 1.35 parts per 1 part NiO would provide relatively poor performance. A 1:1 weight ratio of NiO:Na2 O2 provided a mixture that remained in slurry form with incomplete reaction. An amount of Na2 O2 over about 2.1 parts per 1 part NiO causes rapid destruction of the reaction vessel and does not provide increased electrochemical capacity. Other peroxides similar to sodium peroxide, such as lithium peroxide or lithium oxide and potassium superoxide as well as barium, strontium, and calcium alkaline earth peroxides were found unsuitable.\nWe found that the temperature and time of reaction melt fusion of the NiO and Na2 O2 influenced the capacity of the active product. Temperatures around 700\u00b0-750\u00b0C provided a reaction mixture that was still somewhat semi-solid, indicating slow and incomplete formation of NaNiO2 and incomplete intimate reaction of the NiO and Na2 O2. At a temperature of 600\u00b0C most of the NiO does not react. Temperatures held, after heating the oven, at over 1150\u00b0c provide materials problems in finding suitable reaction vessels which will not degrade very quickly and add deleterious materials to the fused NaNiO2.\nThe useful temperature range for complete fusionreaction, to be maintained after heating the oven, is between about 800\u00b0-1150\u00b0C. The preferred fusion-reaction temperature range, to be maintained after heating the oven, is from about 850\u00b0-1100\u00b0C. The most preferred temperature range in order to assure reuse of the preferred nickel reaction vessel is between about 850\u00b0C -925\u00b0C. The time necessary for fusion will vary depending on temperature. At 800\u00b0-850\u00b0C, 6-8 hours is generally sufficient for complete reaction, while at 850\u00b0-1100\u00b0C or higher, 1/2-3 hours is generally adequate. The best performance was observed at a fusionreaction temperature of 1000\u00b0C for 2 hours.\nThe water temperature for the hydrolysis reaction of the NaNiO2 can be between about 10\u00b0C -95\u00b0C but preferably between about 20\u00b0C -35\u00b0C. When reacted between 20\u00b0C-35\u00b0C the reaction provides more Ni (III) hydroxide i.e., a weight ratio of Ni (II) hydroxide:Ni (III) hydroxide of over about 1:2 providing better electrochemical properties. A higher concentration of the more crystalline Ni (III) hydroxide also provides a composition that loads better into the plaque. The molten NaNiO2 can be quenched in water at NaNiO2 temperatures below about 600\u00b0C, i.e., the NaNiO2 can be cooled to below 600\u00b0C and then immersed in water; this however produces a very active hydrolysis, and it is preferred to cool the NaNiO2 to between 20\u00b0C -95\u00b0C before hydrolysis. Also of particular advantage in this method, NaOH solution is produced which may be further used as a battery electrolyte.\nThe final active material will contain nickel hydrated oxides and hydroxide forms plus cobalt hydroxide. it will also contain about 0.5 to 5 wt% but generally about 2 wt% unhydrolyzed or unreacted NaNiO2, based on dried nickel hydrated oxides and hydroxides plus cobalt hydroxide forms. This sodium material imparts important reduced swelling properties. The active material is then washed and dried. This material can be made into a high density fluid active battery paste for application to battery plaques. The active material after drying up to 65\u00b0C contains water molecules between spaced --O-Ni-O-- layers. It is essential that the water remain in the structure. Therefore, drying is of a partial nature and must be accomplished at a temperature and humidity effective to retain an optimum amount of the interlaminar H2 O. Generally the temperature limits are between about 15\u00b0C to 65\u00b0C with a preferred range of 20\u00b0C-40\u00b0C. Above 65\u00b0C drying and the electrochemical activity starts to decrease. Above 100\u00b0C drying, the electrochemical activity continues to decrease to the extent that the material starts to become inactive. Above 130\u00b0C involves complete drying and the cubic Nio electrochemically inactive state is formed.\nFor simplicity, one of the nickel hydroxide forms comprising the final hydrated active material has been written as nickel (III) hydroxide. This is a simplified way of stating an average between Ni (II) and Ni (IV) hydroxides. There is considerable speculation as to the precise formula of the higher valent, oxidized nickel hydroxide. Analysis of several samples of hydrolyzed NaNiO2 were obtained using the dimethylglyoxime gravimetric technique. The results indicate that a primary nickel compound corresponds to a stoichiometry of Ni3 O4.2H2 O, a nickel oxide hydrate. For the purposes of this application, the term nickel (III) hydroxide and nickel hydrated oxides and hydroxide forms will be used to identify the electrochemically active nickel compound obtained by the substantially complete chemical hydrolysis reaction of NaNiO2.\nThe sodium peroxide, nickel oxide, cobalt and cobalt oxide starting materials, as well as cobalt hydroxide and water soluble cobalt salt additives are preferred to be substantially pure, i.e., no more than about 5% of electrochemically harmful impurities that cannot be washed away. Fortunately, commercial grades of black nickel oxide powder are sufficiently pure to be used as supplied.\nEXAMPLE 1\nAn electrode powder active battery material containing about 98 wt% cobalt . nickel hydroxide was mixed by placing in a container and thoroughly blending 7.6 grams (0.10 mole) of 99+% pure, finely divided black nickel oxide, NiO, (containing 78 wt% or 5.9 grams Ni) and 0.38 grams (0.005 mole) of 99% pure cobalt oxide, mostly in the form of CoO, (containing 70 wt% or about 0.27 gram Co) with 11.7 grams (0.15 mole) of C. P. (96.5% chemically pure) grade sodium peroxide, Na2 O2. The nickel oxide consisted essentially of NiO and was commercially available as INCO black NiO; the cobalt oxide comprised mostly CoO and was commercially available as BAKER reagent cobalt oxide, containing 70 wt% Co. This provided approximately a 3.4 wt% cobalt concentration based on nickel oxide plus cobalt content, i.e., 0.27 g Co divided by (7.6 g NiO + 0.27 g Co); and a weight ratio of NiO:Na2 O2 of about 1:1.54.\nThis mixture was then placed in a nickel crucible and gradually heated for about 1 hour up to about 800\u00b0C in air, in a ceramic lined oven with Nichrome heating coils. Temperatures were monitored using a Pt-PtRh thermocouple introduced at the rear of the oven. After the oven was heated up to 800\u00b0C, the temperature was increased and maintained at the fusion-reaction temperature of between about 950\u00b0C-  1025\u00b0C for an additional 1 hour, to ensure substantially complete chemical melt-fusion reaction to a substantially pure NaNiO2 NaCoO2 mixture.\nThe crucible and reaction product contents were then cooled to about 25\u00b0C over a 6 hour period, after which the crucible containing a solid mass of material was immersed in a 250 ml beaker of water at about 25\u00b0C. The contents hydrolyzed over a 12-hour period, and dispersed in the water to provide an active battery material powder containing about 98 wt% reacted oxide hydrates and hydroxides with about 2 wt% sodium on a dried basis as unreacted NaNiO2. The heavy brown-black solid active material settled immediately in the beaker and was separated using a conventional Buchner apparatus. It was washed with successive 100 ml portions of water until neutral to litmus. This provided a dense brown-black crystalline powder material. It was noted that the nickel crucible was somewhat degraded after the reaction. The filtrate consisted of NaOH solution, which could be used later as a battery electrolyte.\nThe active battery powder was then air dried at only 25\u00b0C, so as not to eliminate interlaminar water in the crystals, and sieved to -325 mesh, i.e., about 98% of the powder had a diameter of less than about 44 microns. This powder was then loaded into nickel battery plaques or grids. The grids were 90-95% porous, 100 mil thick diffusion bonded nickel plated steel wool fiber plaques, having an area of about 1 sq. in. They were loaded using a conventional suction platform. An aqueous slurry of the active material was made to provide a high density fluid paste which was added from a blender until the plaques were filled. Additional water was dropped onto the loaded electrode plates from a funnel to obtain optimum packing within the plaque support.\nSample 1(a) electrodes, having an initial thickness of about 100 mils, were than pressed at about 20,000 lb/sq.in., to a final thickness approximating 60 mils. The loading in each plaque was about 1.5 grams/sq.in. of plaque surface area. Sample 1(b) electrodes, having an initial thickness of about 100 mils, but more heavily loaded, were then pressed at about 20,000 lb/sq.in., to a final thickness approximately 80 mils. The loading in each plaque was about 2.5 grams/sq. in.\nThe nickel electrodes of Samples 1(a) and 1(b) were set opposite negative electrodes in several containers, and contacted with electrolyte to form electrochemical cells. The nickel hydroxide electrodes were \"formed\", i.e., charge and discharge cycled versus sintered cadmium electrodes of considerably larger size and capacity. They were charged for about 21/4 hours at a current density of about 0.3 amp/sq.in. in 25 wt% aqueous KOH and discharged through a 10 ohm resistor at a current density of approximately 120 mA/sq.cm. in 25 wt% aqueous KOH electrolyte. The amount of charge for each cell was adjusted to about 250% of the theoretical nickel capacity based on a single electron transfer per nickel atom.\nThe cycling increases the porosity of the electrode, allowing increased electrolyte penetration and higher output. Initially, the active material is tightly packed and the electrolyte is restricted from contacting the interior of the electrode. An electrode is ready for use after \"forming\" for about 10 to 35 cycles. The active material after \"formation\" did not show any appreciable swelling in the battery electrode plate.\nCapacity values which we considered acceptable for nickel hydroxide battery material were over about 0.185 amphr/gram active material after 25 cycles. This would provide an active battery material highly effective in approaching theoretical values and much improved over the prior art. Theoretical values for one-electron transfer, at 0.255 amp hr/g, are shown on FIG. 1 as a broken horizontal line. The capacity of the electrodes made by the method described above are also shown on FIG. 1, as curves 1(a) and 1(b), providing a capacity at 25 cycles of between about 0.225- 0.20 amp-hr/g. The electrochemical performance of Sample 1(b) is about the same as for Sample 1(a) even though the electrode is much thicker and more heavily loaded. This is of particular advantage, indicating that low loadings, providing even lower materials costs, will still provide excellent electrochemical results.\nAn electrode powder active battery material, Sample 1(c), containing about 98 wt% reacted oxide hydrates and hydroxide forms was made by adding about 10 grams reagent grade, 99% pure, cobalt nitrate solution, Co(NO3)2. 6H2 O, (containing 20 wt% or 0.35 gram cobalt) to the strongly alkaline hydrolyzed slurry after the crucible was immersed in water, rather than adding cobalt additive to the NiO + Na2 O2 mixture before fusion. This provided an active battery material containing cobalt (II) hydroxide dispersed throughout. The mixture before fusion contained 7.6 grams NiO and 11.7 grams C.P. grade sodium peroxide, providing a weight ratio of NiO:Na2 O2 of about 1:1.54. The same fusion, cooling, hydrolysis and washing cycle was followed as described for Samples 1(a) and 1(b) above. The cobalt concentration based on nickel oxide plus Co content was 4.4 wt%, i.e., 7.6 g. Ni:0.35 g. Co. This active battery material was loaded, pressed, set opposite negative electrodes to form a cell, and charged and discharged as described above for Sample 1(a).\nThe capacity of this electrode is also shown in FIG. 1, as curve 1(c), providing a capacity at 25 cycles of about 0.19 amps-hr/g. Mixing the cobalt additive initially as CoO, as in Samples 1(a) and 1(b), appears to provide an electrode active material with more capacity, probably because of the intimate interaction with NiO and Na2 O2 during the melt-fusion reaction, and is the preferred method of adding cobalt to the battery material.\nThe cobalt could also be added by dipping or spraying a plaque containing the nickel hydroxide after loading, followed by dipping or spraying with high purity alkali hydroxide to precipitate cobalt hydroxide and then washing the plaque. When the cobalt weight percent is between 2-12 wt% the results would be similar to Sample 1(c). Cobalt can also be added as high purity Co(OH)2 after hydrolysis and when the cobalt weight percent is between 2-12 wt% the results would again be similar to Sample 1(c). None of the post fusion cobalt addition methods, either as a cobalt hydroxide or as soluble cobalt nitrate or cobalt chloride salts, provide as complete a homogeneous mixing of the cobalt with the nickel hydroxides.\nNickel analysis of several batches of the hydrolyzed NaNiO2 of Samples 1(a) and 1(b) were obtained, using the dimethyglyoxime gravimetric technique. The results indicate 50-60 wt% nickel due to varying degrees of hydration, plus cobalt, oxygen and residual sodium, as shown in TABLE 1 below:\n\n               TABLE 1______________________________________Nickel analysis for fully hydrolyzed NaNiO.sub.2 samplesSample Wt. (g.)          Ni Content (g.)  % Ni______________________________________0.155          0.0890           57.60.147          0.0902           61.40.151          0.0842           55.70.148          0.0840           56.8______________________________________\nThe leaching of sodium from NaNiO2 was very slow. Even after a week of washing a sample of finely ground NaNiO2 with water, the sodium content was still about 1.0 percent.\nThe hydrolyzed NaNiO2 starts to lose significant weight above 130\u00b0C. Some interlaminar water is believed to be lost at heating temperatures over about 45\u00b0C-65\u00b0C. In the range of 130\u00b0C-240\u00b0C, the compound loses oxygen and residual water amounting to about 13.0 wt%. Heating above about 130\u00b0C involves complete drying and eliminates almost all interlaminar water, causing Ni in the crystal structure to link with 4-6 oxygen atoms forming a cubic electrochemically inactive state. The values resulting from the dimethyglyoxime analysis of the active material closely correspond to a stoichiometry of nickelo-nickelic hydrate, Ni3 O4 . 2H2 O, in a layer like --O-Ni-O-Ni-O-Ni-O-- form with interlaminar water, which on conversion to NiO, would lose about 18.9% of its weight. The nickel content of Ni3 O4 . 2H2 O is calculated to be about 63.6%. The values given in Table 1, when corrected for the 5-6% cobalt additive, agree with this percentage reasonably well.\nEXAMPLE 2\nAn electrode powder active battery material was mixed by placing in a container and thoroughly blending 7.6 grams of 99+% pure NiO (containing 5.9 grams Ni) and 0.56  grams of 99% pure cobalt oxide (containing about 0.44 grams Co) with 11.7 grams of C.P. grade sodium peroxide, Na2 O2. This provided approximately a 5.5 wt% cobalt concentration based on nickel oxide plus cobalt content, i.e., 7.6 g. NiO + 0.44 g. Co. and a weight ratio of NiO:Na2 O2 of about 1:1.54.\nThis mixture, i.e., NiO:1.5 Na2 O2 with 5.5 wt% Co, was then placed in nickel crucibles and 4 batches, Samples 2(a) -2(d), gradually heated about 1 hour up to 800\u00b0C in air, in a ceramic lined oven with Nichrome heating coils. Temperatures were monitored using a Pt-PtRh thermocouple introduced at the rear of the oven. The temperature was then increased and maintained at the chemical fusion-reaction temperature of 1000\u00b0C for further periods of 20 minutes, Sample 2(a); 1 hour, Sample 2(b); 1.5 hours, Sample 2(c); and 3 hours, Sample 2(d); to determine the effect of fusionreaction time on the electrochemical performance of the active battery material.\nThe crucible was then cooled to 25\u00b0C and immersed in water at 25\u00b0C to hydrolyze and disperse the contents. The hydrolyzed material containing about 98 wt% reacted hydrated oxide and hydroxide forms and 2 wt% unreacted NaNiO2 on a dried basis, was then washed until neutral to litmus, dried at 25\u00b0C, loaded into nickel battery grids, and set opposite negative electrodes to form cells; all steps using the same techniques as described in Sample 1(a) in EXAMPLE 1.\nThe electrochemical activity of these electrodes are shown on FIG. 2. The material heated at 1, 1.5 and 3 hours at the fusion-reaction temperature of 1000\u00b0C provided capacity values at 25 cycles of about 0.21, 0.22 and 0.23 amp-hr/g. The material heated for 20 minutes at the fusionreactor temperature provided capacity values at 25 cycles of 0.17 amp-hr/g. Suitable reaction times at fusion-reaction temperatures of between 800\u00b0-1150\u00b0C would appear from this data to be over about one-half hour and probably up to about 8 hours at the 800\u00b0C temperature range.\nEXAMPLE 3\nAn electrode powder active battery material was made as in Example 2, i.e., NiO:1.54 Na2 O2 with 5.5 wt% Co. Samples of this mixture were then placed in a nickel crucible and heated for 6 hours at 600\u00b0C, Sample 3 (a); 6 hours at 700\u00b0C, Sample 3(b); 6 hours at 800\u00b0C, Sample 3(c); 6 hours at 850\u00b0C, Sample 3(d); and 2 hours at 1100\u00b0C, Sample 3 (e), after initial furnace heating, to determine the effect of temperature on the electrochemical performance of the active battery material. The furnace was the same type used in EXAMPLE 2.\nThe crucible was then cooled to 25\u00b0C and immersed in water at 25\u00b0C to hydrolyze and disperse the contents. The hydrolyzed material, containing about 98 wt% reacted hydrated oxide and hydroxide forms and 2 wt% unreacted NaNiO2 on a dried basis, was then washed, dried at 25\u00b0C, loaded into nickel battery grids, and set opposite negative electrodes to form cells, all steps using the same techniques as described in Sample 1(a) in EXAMPLE 1.\nThe electrochemical activity of these electrodes are shown on FIG. 3, where the materials heated at 800\u00b0, 850\u00b0 and 1100\u00b0C provided capacity values at 25 cycles of about 0.19, 0.20 and 0.23 amp-hr/g respectively. The materials heated at 600\u00b0 and 700\u00b0C provided capacity values at 10 cycles of only about 0.05 and 0.15 amp-hr/g. Suitable fusion-reaction temperatures would appear from the data to be between about 800\u00b0C to 1100\u00b0C or higher, although at temperatures above about 925\u00b0C the nickel reaction vessel shows signs of deterioration.\nEXAMPLE 4\nElectrode powder active battery material was mixed by placing in a container and thoroughly blending 7.6 grams of 99+% pure NiO (containing 5.9 grams Ni) and 0.56 grams of 99% pure cobalt oxide (containing 0.4 grams Co), to provide a 5.5 wt% cobalt concentration, with about 7.6 grams of C.P. grade Na2 O2, Sample 4(a); about 9.5 grams of C.P. grade Na2 O2, Sample 4 (b); about 11.7 grams of C.P. grade Na2 O2, Sample 4 (c); and about 15.2 grams of C.P. grade Na2 O2, Sample 4(d). This provided weight ratios of NiO:Na2 O2 of about 1:1; 1:1.25; 1:1.5; and 1:2.0 respectively. The mixtures were then placed in a nickel crucible, heated, and then fuse-melted at a fusion-reaction temperature of 1000\u00b0C for 3 hours.\nThese materials were then cooled to 25\u00b0C, and immersed in water at 25\u00b0C to hydrolyze them to Co hydroxide plus Ni hydrated oxide and hydroxide forms and about 2 wt% unreacted NaNiO2 on a dried basis. The material was then washed, dried at 25\u00b0C, loaded into nickel battery plaques at a loading of about 1.5 grams/sq.in., and set opposite negative electrodes to form a cell, all steps using the same techniques as described for Sample 1(a) in EXAMPLE 1.\nThe electrochemical activity of these electrodes are shown on FIG. 4, where the materials having weight ratios of NiO:Na2 O2 of 1:1.5 provided capacity values at 25 cycles of about 0.23 and 0.22 amp-hr/g. The materials having weight ratios of NiO:Na2 O2 of 1:1 and 1:1.25 provided capacity values at 25 cycles of about 0.08 and 0.15 amp-hr/g. Suitable weight ratios of NiO:Na2 O2 would appear from the FIgure data to be between about 1:1.35 to about 1:2.1.\nEXAMPLE 5\nElectrode powder active battery material was mixed by placing in a container and thoroughly blending 7.6 grams of 99+% pure NiO (containing 78 wt% or 5.9 grams Ni) and 11.7 grams of C.P. grade Na2 O2, to provide a weight ratio of NiO:Na2 O2 of 1:1.54, with about 0.23 grams of 99% pure cobalt oxide (containing 70 wt% or 0.16 gram Co), Sample 5(a); about 0.38 grams of 99% pure cobalt oxide (containing 0.3 gram Co), Sample 5(b); about 0.7 grams of 99% pure cobalt oxide (containing 0.49 gram Co), Sample 5(c); about 0.9 grams of 99% pure cobalt oxide (containing 0.63 gram Co), Sample 5(d); and Sample 5(e) containing no cobalt addition either before fusion or after hydrolysis. This provided cobalt concentrations, based on nickel oxide plus cobalt content as Co of approximately about 2.1 wt%, 3.8 wt%, 6.1 wt%, 7.6 wt%, and 0 wt% respectively. The mixtures were then placed in a nickel crucible, heated, and then fuse-melted at a fusion-reaction temperature of 1000\u00b0C for 3 hours.\nThese materials were then cooled to 25\u00b0C, and immersed in water at 25\u00b0C to hydrolyze them to about 98 wt% reacted hydrated oxide and hydroxide forms and 2 wt% unreacted NaNiO2 on a dried basis. The materials were then washed, dried at 25\u00b0C, and loaded into nickel battery plaques, at loadings of 1.7 grams/sq.in. for a final plaque thickness of 70 mils, and set opposite negative electrodes to form a cell, all steps using the same techniques as described for Sample 1(a) in EXAMPLE 1.\nThe electrochemical activity of these electrodes are shown on FIG. 5, where the materials having cobalt concentrations of 2.1 wt%, 3.8 wt%, 6.1 wt%, and 7.6 wt% provided the capacity values at 25 cycles of about 0.22, 0.22, 0.24 and 0.20 amp-hr/g. respectively. The material without cobalt provided a capacity value of only 0.10 amp-hr/g. after 25 cycles. Suitable cobalt addition from this data to provide an acceptable electrode plate ready for insertion into a battery would appear to be between about 2 wt%-12 wt% based on nickel oxide as NiO plus cobalt content as Co.\nEXAMPLE 6\nAs a comparative example, a material, Sample 6, containing between about 95-98 wt% hydrolyxis reaction product was mixed by placing in a container and thoroughly blending 30 grams of 99+% pure NiO, (containing 24 grams Ni), and 2.2 grams of 99% pure cobalt oxide (containing 1.5 grams Co) with 50 grams of C.P. grade potassium superoxide, KO2. This provided a 4.8 wt% cobalt concentration based on nickel oxide plus cobalt content and a weight ratio of NiO:KO2 of about 1:1.65. This mixture was then placed in a nickel crucible and heated over about 1 hour to 800\u00b0C. The temperature was raised and maintained between 950\u00b0-1020\u00b0C for about 2 hours to ensure complete melt fusion reaction to KNiO2 + KCoO2.\nThis material was then cooled to 25\u00b0C, and immersed in water at 25\u00b0C to hydrolyze it. The material was then washed, dried at 25%, loaded into nickel battery plaques at a loading of about 1.5 grams/sq.in., and set opposite negative electrodes to form a cell, all steps using the same techniques as described for Sample 1(a) in EXAMPLE 1. The capacity of these electrodes, Sample 6, made substituting KO2 for Na2 O2, provided a capacity of 0.12 amp-hr/g. after about 25 cycles, indicating much inferior electrochemical performance for this material.\nEXAMPLE 7\nAs a comparative example, an electrode was made, similarly to Sample 1(a) in EXAMPLE 1, where Li2 O was substituted for Na2 O2 in the mixture. The material contained about 3.4 wt% cobalt concentration and a weight ratio of NiO:Li2 O of about 1:1.5. This mixture was fused at 1000\u00b0 C to ensure substantial reaction to CoS.Li2 O, although the mixture remained solid due to the high melting point of Li2 O, cooled to 25\u00b0C, and hydrolyzed in water at 25\u00b0C. The material was then washed, dried at 25\u00b0C, loaded into nickel battery grids, and set opposite negative electrodes to form a cell, all steps using the same techniques as described for Sample 1(a) in EXAMPLE 1. The final product was a grayblack powder with some dispersed metallic-like platelets. The electrodes, Sample 7(a), made by substituting Li2 O for Na2 O2, had only superficial electrochemical activity. X-ray and infrared reasurements indicated that the LiNiO2 contained a cubic NiO structure and not the layer-like NiO2 structure found in NaNiO2 necessary for electrochemical activity.\nAlso, electrode Sample 7(b) was made using the same techniques as described for Sample 1(a) in EXAMPLE 1, but substituting barium peroxide, BaO2, for Na2 O2. The final product, BaNi2 O5 + BaCo2 O5 had no electrochemical activity. X-ray structural patterns also showed NiO sites.

The material contained about 6.5 wt% cobalt concentration and a weight ratio of NiO:Na2 O2 of about 1:1.54. The mixture was fused in a nickel crucible at 1000\u00b0C as in EXAMPLE 2 to ensure complete conversion to NaNiO2. After cooling and hydrolysis, the active battery material powder contained about 98 wt% reacted hydrated oxide and hydroxide forms and 2 wt% unreacted NaNiO2 on a dried basis.\nThe material was washed and then Samples 8(a)-8(f) were air dried at the above described temperatures. The Samples were then sieved to -325 mesh and loaded into nickel battery plaques as in EXAMPLE 2. The electrodes were pressed and had approximately the same loadings as in EXAMPLE 2. These nickel electrodes were set opposite negative electrodes in several containers, and contacted with electrolyte to form electrochemical cells. The electrodes were fromed as in EXAMPLE 2.

It is believed that, even though the Ni3 O4 . 2H2 O does not convert to a cubic inactive form until about 130\u00b0C; interlaminar bonding in the battery material starts to occur above about 60\u00b0C-70\u00b0C; and that this along with interlaminar water loss apparently makes the material dried over about 65\u00b0C ineffective as a battery material.\nWhat exactly happens is not completely understood at this time; it is known, however, that when the electrode material, containing a mixture of Ni (II) and Ni (III) forms, and which is believed to have a stoichiometry of nickel hydrated oxide Ni3 O4 . 2H2 O, is dried at temperatures over 65\u00b0C, it becomes progressively inactive and is not useful as a battery material. It is critical then that the active material of this invention only be dried between about 15\u00b0C-65\u00b0C and preferably at 25\u00b0C. At the higher temperatures of about 65\u00b0C a high humidity environment could be used to minimize interlaminar water loss.\nThe infrared and Raman spectra of the fully hydrolyzed product, containing nickel forms which correspond to a stoichiometry of Ni3 O4 . 2H2 O, when dried below 65\u00b0C, shows a center of symmetry and layer-like --O-Ni-ONi-O-Ni-O-- structure with water molecules dispersed in interlaminar positions. The crystalline layer structure is hexagonal and belongs to the same group Dd3 3 (P3m).\nUnexpectedly, only the Na2 O2 + NiO reaction product, when the components are reacted within critical weight percent, temperature and time ranges, and when combined with critical weight percent Co during fusion, during hydrolysis, after hydrolysis or after plaque pasting, provides suitable high performance active battery material for use in making battery electrode plates. This active material, formed by hydrolyzing NaNiO2 and adding about 2-12 wt% Co based on NiO plus Co has a capacity of at least 0.185 amp-hr/gram. When it is used in a metallic plaque it provides an electrode that can be alternately stacked in a container opposite negative electrodes, such as for example electrodes containing iron active battery material, with separators therebetween and a suitable caustic electrolyte contacting the electrodes and separators, with suitable electrical connections, to provide a battery.\n", "claims": "\nWe claim as our invention:\n \n1.

It is particularly applicable to electrochemical cells that employ metal sulfides as positive electrode (cathode) reactants and alkali metals as negative (anode) electrode reactants.\nA substantial amount of work has been done in the development of these types of electrochemical cells and their electrodes. Various type cells showing promise have employed lithium, lithium-aluminum alloy or sodium as the reactant within the negative electrode. In the positive electrode, the chalcogens, particularly sulfur and sulfur compounds, have been used. Electrolytes of molten salt generally containing the ions of the negative reactant provide ionic conduction between the electrodes. Examples of these secondary, high-temperature cells are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,827,910 to Cairns et al., entitled \"Homogeneous Cathode Mixtures for Secondary Electrochemical Power-Producing Cells\", Aug. 6, 1974; 3,716,409 to Cairns et al., entitled \"Cathodes for Secondary Electrochemical Power-Producing Cells\", Feb. 13, 1973; and 3,488,221 to Hiroshi Shimotake et al., Jan. 6, 1970. A number of other pending patent applications relating to these type cells include ERDA case No. S-44,393, Ser. No. 510,840 to Yao et al. and entitled \"Electrochemical Cell Assembled in Discharged State\", filed Sept. 30, 1974 and ERDA case No. S-43,384, Ser. No. 416,311 entitled \"Modular Electrochemical Cell\", now U.S. Pat. No. 3,887,396, June 3, 1975, to Walsh et al. Each of these patents and patent applications are assigned to the assignee of the present application.\nThe iron sulfides FeS2 and FeS have been found to be particularly attractive sulfur compounds for use as positive electrode reactants. These materials are readily available and are much more easily contained within the cell than elemental sulfur. Although FeS2 has a lower equivalent weight and generally performs better within the positive electrode than FeS, it reacts with and degrades iron components within the cell to form FeS. Consequently, inert materials such as molybdenum or tungsten are required for use in current collectors and electrical terminals in contact with FeS2 cathode compositions. Contrastingly, FeS is relatively inert to iron and can be operated as a positive electrode reactant in contact with iron or mild steel current collectors and terminals for long periods of time.\nPositive electrode compositions employing only FeS as the cathode reactant have given less than the expected performance in, for instance, reactant utilization, cell capacity and power. The addition of electrically conductive materials such as iron or carbon either as solid current collectors or as powdered materials dispersed throughout the positive electrode composition have provided only some of the desired improvements in cell performance.\nOne theory regarding problems in the operation of a cell employing FeS reactant is the formation during the charge cycle of a new solid phase having the tentative composition of K2 Fe7 S8 and possibly containing small amounts of Li. This composition or phase will hereafter be referred to as the J phase. The J phase contains substantial quantities of potassium from reaction with the electrolyte. Consequently, its formation causes a shift in the electrolyte composition that may have an adverse effect on the long-term operation of the cell as well as contribute to electrode swelling.\nIn previous studies with Li/FeS cells, metallographic and X-ray diffraction examinations of the positive electrodes have revealed that the J phase is the dominant, solid sulfide phase in a well charged cell that originally included FeS as the cathode reactant material. FeS could be produced on recharge of these cells by using somewhat higher cutoff voltages. The required charge voltage for conversion of J phase to FeS appears to vary inversely with temperature. For example, about 2 volts is required at 440\u00b0C., while about 2.2 volts charge produces FeS at 380\u00b0C. However, in cells employing iron current collector material, the higher cutoff voltages would tend to oxidize the iron and degrade the current collector structure.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nTherefore, in view of the problems associated with the prior cathode compositions using FeS as the primary cathode reactant, it is an object of the present invention to provide a cathode reactant composition including FeS that exhibits improved cell performance.\nIt is also an object to provide an improved cathode composition including FeS that provides increased power density at high current densities.\nIt is a further object to provide a cathode composition including FeS that can be employed within a high-temperature electrochemical cell with increased capacity and utilization of reactant at high current densities.\nIn accordance with the present invention, a secondary, high-temperature electrochemical cell is presented including an alkali metal reactant in the anode, a cathode reactant composition including FeS in the cathode and an electrolyte containing ions of the alkali metal between the two electrodes. The cathode reactant composition comprises a mixture of a major proportion by weight FeS and a minor proportion by weight Cu2 S.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\nThe present invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein:\nFIG. 1 is an elevation view of a laboratory electrochemical cell employed to test the present invention.\nFIG. 2 is a graph showing the capacity, temperature and current density of an electrochemical cell including FeS as the cathode reactant.\nFIG. 3 is a graph showing the capacity, temperature and current density of an electrochemical cell including FeS and a minor proportion of Cu2 S as the cathode reactant.\nFIG. 4 is a graph of cell current density v cell capacity presenting comparison of the two electrochemical cells of FIGS. 2 and 3.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT\nIn FIG. 1, an experimental electrochemical cell is shown contained within a ceramic crucible 11. The cell includes an anode 13 (negative electrode), a cathode 15 (positive electrode) separated or submerged within a molten salt electrolyte 17. Electrical conductors 19 and 21 extend from the cathode and anode, respectively, for connection to electrical instrumentation (not shown) for evaluating the cell.\nThe anode 13 submerged within electrolyte 17 is supported above the cathode by electrical conductor 21. It is surrounded by a cylinder of electrically insulative material 23 such as beryllia. This prevents electrical shorting of the cell through any loose electrode materials that may have escaped during operation.\nThe anode as shown can be a porous substrate material of such as stainless steel in the form of felt, foam or wool impregnated with an anode reactant such as molten lithium or sodium. The anode might also comprise a solid porous substrate of lithium-aluminum alloy or other alkali metal alloys that are solid at the cell operating temperature, e.g. 375\u00b0 to 500\u00b0C.\nThe electrolyte 17 that surrounds the two electrodes can be a eutectic salt composition that is molten at the cell operating temperature. Electrolytes such as eutectic compositions of LiCl-KCl or LiCl-LiF-KBr salts have been found to be suitable for this purpose. Various other suitable electrolytic salts can be selected from those listed in U.S. Pat.

The cathode structure as illustrated and as used in some of the experimental tests demonstrating the present invention is a graphite cup 26 having an upper porous graphite cover 27 to permit permeation of the electrolytic salt.\nIn practice, various cell designs may be used with the improved cathode reactant composition of the present invention. The cell of FIG. 1 merely represents an example of the type cell used experimentally to test and prove the operability of the present invention. One other, and perhaps more practical, cell design which could be used in making up electrochemical batteries for off-peak storage of electrical power or as a power source for an electric vehicle is illustrated and described in the assignee's copending patent application Ser. No. 416,311 cited above.\nThe positive electrode composition illustrated at 25 in FIG. 1 is a uniform mixture of FeS and Cu2 S. In some instances it is desirable to add an inert, electrically conductive material such as powdered iron, iron filings or powdered carbon to enhance current collection within the composition. Solid conductors of iron or other suitable inert, electrically conducting materials are also often employed within the composition to provide good electrical conduction to the electrode terminals.\nThe proportion of the active materials or reactants, FeS and Cu2 S, are selected such that a minimum quantity of Cu2 S is employed with maximum FeS to effectuate a substantial increase in cell capacity, power and reactant utilization. It is expected that a minimum of 5% Cu2 S by weight will be required for this purpose. Large ratios of Cu2 S to FeS are not only not preferred but are also unsuitable for obtaining the benefits of the present invention, due to, for instance, the higher equivalent weight of Cu2 S. The present invention comprehends positive electrode compositions containing major proportions by weight of FeS and minor proportions by weight Cu2 S, that is, within a range of about 5% to about 35% by weight Cu2 S. From the experimental results that have been obtained, it is seen that substantial and unexpected improvement in cell performance occurs with positive electrode compositions containing 16 to 20% by weight Cu2 S additions into FeS.\nIn providing the improved electrode compositions, a uniform and homogeneous blend of FeS and Cu2 S is prepared. Fine powders, e.g. about 100 to 400 microns size, of each of these constituents can be thoroughly blended into a uniform mixture. It is of importance that no large domains of FeS are left to react with the electrolyte to form the solid J phase.\nOne manner of ensuring a near uniform composition of FeS and Cu2 S is to melt powders of the materials in the desired proportions at about 1200\u00b0C. and form a molten solution. After thorough blending, the melt is frozen rapidly by casting in a cold metal mold of sufficient mass and heat capacity to cool the melt to about 900\u00b0C. in about 3 minutes. The rapid solidification produces a solid ingot with a minimum amount of macroscopic nonuniformity. The ingot contains a solid solution of Cu2 S in FeS and one or more ternary Cu-Fe-S phases such as chalcopyrite, CuFeS2 and bornite, Cu5 FeS4. The cooled ingot, having a near uniform composition, is ground to a fine powder of about 100 to 400 microns particle size and blended thoroughly. Most of the individual particles will contain both a solid solution of Cu2 S in FeS and one or more ternary phases, since the crystal structure formed by this method will be of smaller scale than these particle sizes.\nAlthough the invention as described and claimed herein is directed to compositions of Cu2 S and FeS as positive electrode materials, various other additives to FeS and FeS2 are also contemplated for the production of improved positive electrodes. For instance, transition metal sulfides such as those of cobalt and nickel might also be added to FeS in minor proportions to enhance the performance of the positive electrode within a secondary, high-temperature electrochemical cell. Several of these transition metal sulfides have been suggested by the applicants as possible positive electrode reactants along with combinations of Cu2 S and FeS in \"Extended Abstracts of the Battery Division: The Electrochemical Society\", Fall meeting, New York, N. Y., Oct. 13-17, 1974.\nIn order to demonstrate the present invention, a number of cells similar to that illustrated and described in FIG. 1 were set up and operated with various cathode compositions. The first of the cells employed only FeS powder as the active cathode material, another employed only Cu2 S and the remaining cells included a mixture of Cu2 S and FeS. One of the cells designated (K-l) used a commercial matte containing both Cu2 S and FeS as the positive electrode material. This type matte is routinely produced in an early separation step in the recovery of copper metal from ore. The ore is melted and iron silicate slag removed, leaving the heavier molten matte of primarily Cu2 S and FeS with a few percent of other metallic sulfides and impurities.\nEach of the cells had a negative electrode area of about 5 cm2 and a positive electrode area of about 4.75 cm2. The negative electrodes included a substrate and current collector of porous stainless steel Feltmetal (a trademark) impregnated with molten lithium metal at the cell operating temperature. The interelectrode spacing in each cell was about 1 cm.\nTables I, II and III are given below to summarize the characteristics of these electrochemical cells. Table I gives the physical characteristics of the over-all cell, while Table II shows the composition and source of the positive electrode materials. Table III gives some of the electrical performance characteristics for each of these five cells.\n\n                                   TABLE I__________________________________________________________________________Cell Designation  Li/FeS                   Li/FeS-Cu.sub.2 S                           Li/FeS-Cu.sub.2 S                                   Li/Cu.sub.2 S                                         Li/FeS-Cu.sub.2 S             (1)   (2)     (K-1)   (3)   (4)__________________________________________________________________________Negative Electrode   Wt.

This may be due to the formation of the J (tentatively K2 Fe7 S8) phase in the fully charged electrode. Not only is the J phase a solid material at the cell operating temperature, but in its formation by removing KCl from the electrolyte, it can cause the crystallization of an approximately equivalent amount of LiCl, thus reducing the amount of molten electrolyte associated with the positive electrode. At the lower operating temperatures (e.g. 380\u00b0-450\u00b0C.), pockets or crusts of solidified LiCl could be formed within the positive electrode to dampen its performance.\nOne particular characteristic associated with the J phase and observed with the Li/FeS cells is that at sufficiently high charge voltages it can be converted to FeS. At 380\u00b0C. this appeared to occur at about 2.2 volts (IR included), while at 490\u00b0C. a charge voltage of only about 1.7 volts (IR included) appeared to produce FeS. Consequently, in plots of charge voltage versus time the lower temperature cells show two plateaus, one for the conversion of the cell reaction product to J phase and the second plateau representing the conversion of J phase to FeS. Both of these conversions appear to occur at about the same voltage for cell temperatures of 490\u00b0C. and above. The higher charge voltages, however, are undesirable within a cell containing iron as current collector material, because of its possible oxidation to FeCl2. In addition, the higher operating temperatures are to be avoided in order to extend the life of electrical insulators and electrode feedthrough components.\nAn examination of Table III, showing the results of the operation of the five cells, reveals substantial improvement for the cells including small weight percentages of Cu2 S additive to the FeS positive electrode material. In cell 1, having only the FeS as the positive electrode composition, the fully charged positive electrode included both FeS and J phase, but it was necessary to employ elevated charge voltage at the cell termination (2.3 volts) to obtain conversion to FeS. In cell 2, having 20 wt. % Cu2 S, some J phase was observed, but in a substantially reduced amount to that found in previous FeS electrodes charged at the same voltages and temperatures. In cells K-1 and 4, having approximately 32 and 17 wt. % Cu2 S, no J phase was detected even at the reduced termination voltages.\nIt is also seen from Table III that improvement in the utilization of the positive electrode material, that is, the average capacity as a percent of theoretical, results from the addition of minor percentages of Cu2 S to the FeS positive electrode material. This is a completely unexpected result, as the average capacity of cell 3 employing Cu2 S alone as a positive electrode reactant exhibits rather poor utilization of the positive electrode material. It is also to be noted that these increases in utilization occur at low current densities, e.g. 20 to 40 mA/cm2. More substantial improvements are to be described below in conjunction with tests conducted at higher current densities.\nIn order to further illustrate the improvement of the Cu2 S additions in the positive electrodes, Table IV compares other features of three of the above cells at the lower operating temperatures (385\u00b0-390\u00b0C.). The data of Table IV was obtained from a linear plot of short-time voltage and current reading for a half dozen or more points between the open circuit voltage and about a 1 volt cutoff on discharge. The average power density of the cell is obtained by these voltage-current measurements at 1 volt on the linear plot.\n\n               TABLE IV______________________________________                 Current at Power density      Open circuit                 1 volt cut-                            at 1 volt% by wt.

This, of course, means that the cell resistance has been lowered to substantially below that which would be expected by the addition of a small amount of Cu2 S. It is also seen from Table IV that the average power density of the cell is unexpectedly increased to about that with the Cu2 S electrode while still retaining a major proportion of FeS. The composition of FeS-Cu2 S is of substantial advantage over Cu2 S alone because of its lower weight per unit capacity and its greater availability.\nIn order to further demonstrate the improvement afforded by use of a Cu2 S additive to an FeS positive electrode composition, two nearly identical cells DS-11 and DS-13 were operated. The structure of these cells was somewhat different from that shown in FIG. 1 in that the positions of the positive and negative electrodes were reversed. Also the negative electrode comprised a lithium-aluminum alloy supported on the bottom of the cell and covered with a boron nitride interelectrode separator. The positive electrode was supported above the negative electrode and included an iron mesh basket lined with zirconia cloth for containing the positive electrode composition. The first of these cells, designated DS-11, included only FeS in the cathode composition, while the second cell, designated DS-13, included a uniform mixture of 16.8 wt. % Cu2 S (10 mol %) and the remainder FeS. Other details of these cells are shown in Table V.\n\n               TABLE V______________________________________Cell No.         DS-11      DS-13Cell Type        LiAl/FeS   LiAl/FeS-Cu.sub.2 S______________________________________Positive electrode   Area, cm.sup.2            25         25   Theor. capacity    amp-hr       25         25   Wt.

This indicated the high diffusion overvoltage within the electrodes. By raising the cell operating temperature to 500\u00b0C. a substantial improvement in capacity was realized gradually. After about 28 cycles at this temperature, 80% utilization was achieved. On subsequently lowering the temperature again to 450\u00b0C., the utilization dropped slightly to about 55% at 120 milliamps/cm2. The complete history of cell DS-11 is presented in FIG. 2.\nCell DS-13 was constructed to be nearly identical to cell DS-11, except that approximately 10 mol % Cu2 S (16.8 wt. %) was included with FeS as the positive electrode composition. The cell was operated for over 800 hours at near 450\u00b0C. After a short initial break-in period of high resistance, the cell operated with a percent utilization of active material in the positive electrode of about 75% at 120 mA/cm2 to about 65% at 160 mA/cm2. FIG. 3 is presented as a record of this cell's history. As a result of including the Cu2 S as an additive in the positive electrode material, performance of this cell is essentially identical to that of cell DS-11 at the higher temperature of 500\u00b0C.\nFIG. 4 illustrates the improvement in capacity attributable to the addition of Cu2 S to the FeS positive electrode composition. The performance of the cell having only FeS as the positive electrode reactant at 500\u00b0C. nearly coincides with that shown in FIG. 4 for the FeS-Cu2 S reactant at 450\u00b0C. Thus, by adding Cu2 S in a minor proportion to the positive electrode composition, a capacity increase equivalent to that obtained by a 50\u00b0C. increase in temperature is achieved.\nIt can therefore be seen from the above description and experimental results that the new and improved positive electrode composition of the present invention provides increased utilization, lower resistance and increased power over that in comparable cells using only the individual positive electrode reactants. The use of minor percentages of Cu2 S within an FeS cathode achieves performance equivalent to that previously achievable only at high temperatures. The addition of Cu2 S to the FeS composition appears to minimize or eliminate the formation of a solid J phase that also incorporated electrolyte constituents and thereby possibly produced domains having elevated electrolyte melting points. The results are completely unexpected, as the performance of cells having compositions of FeS and Cu2 S in the positive electrodes is shown to exceed that of cells having either one of these sulfides alone as reactants.\n", "claims": "\nThe embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows:\n \n1.

Field of the Invention\nThe invention relates to a device for indicating the need for service or inspection of a motor vehicle, wherein the service or inspection is carried out whenever the vehicle has travelled certain mileage. An indicator is provided which, at the end of the prespecified mileage, generates a visible or audible signal.\n2. Description of the Prior Art\nFor the decontamination of exhaust gases of motor vehicles, exhaust gas catalysts have lately been developed which are installed in the exhaust system. Such catalysts are generally no longer effective after having been in use for a certain period of time and must then be replaced by fresh ones. Therefore, the need for a device exists which after a certain mileage, generally 12,500 km (i.e., 7767.5 miles), indicates by means of a visible or audible signal the replacement to be carried out, and in which the signal can only be extinguished after replacement of the catalysts, so as to permit a control of the replacement by the traffic police or other governmental authorities.\nTo indicate the need for a service or inspection to be carried out after a certain mileage has been covered, a number of devices are already known. In most of these devices, a switch contact is provided in connection with the odometer of the motor vehicle, and the switch contact is actuated after a specific mileage to generate a visible or audible signal. Such devices have the disadvantage that, during continuing operation, the signal is extinguished after a number of miles, regardless of whether or not the service or inspection work has been carrried out. Another known device contains a cam driven by an odometer, which cam acts upon a unilaterally clamped-in leaf spring whose free end engages a groove in a spring-loaded indication drum. After a specific mileage the leaf spring is disengaged from the indicating roller by the cam, which therefore pivots into its indicating position. A considerable disadvantage of this device is that, when the service or inspection work must be carried out somewhat earlier than required, the signal is nevertheless switched on after the prespecified mileage has been reached. Moreover, a switching-off of the notice is only possible after a certain mileage has been covered. Besides, such a device presents the disadvantage of being bulky and must be placed in a casing of its own, outside the tachometer. Electrochemical elements are used for measurement mileage travelled by rental automobiles to calculate rental fees in U.S. Pat. No. 3,665,397 and 3,754,122.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nThese disadvantages are to be eliminated by the invention. The invention therefore creates a device wherein the visible or audible signal, once it has appeared, can be reextinguished by zeroing of the device by an authorized person, and an extinction of the indicator by re-zeroing is possible even before the end of the prespecified mileage without producing a premature signal thereafter. Furthermore, the structural volume of the device should be such that it can be installed within the tachometer of a motor vehicle.\nThe invention provides an indicator in the form of an electrochemical ampere-hour cell, controlled by a speed-signal transmitter which produces a signal proportional to the prevailing motor vehicle speed, operating by integration to measure the predetermined mileage.\nThe current supplied by the speedometer generally consists of pulses equal polarity, whose number per time unit is proportional to the motor vehicle speed. This current causes an electrochemical reaction of the electrolyte which is stronger when the number of current pulses per time unit and therefore the speed of the motor vehicle is greater. Since, according to Faraday's law, the quantity of the materials converted by reaction in an electrolytic cell is proportional to the quantity of electric current which has passed the cell, the quantity of materials converted by reaction is proportional to the mileage covered by the motor vehicle.\nBy the use of commercial electrochemical ampere-hour cells of small structure which indicate directly or indirectly the electrolytically reacted material quantity and thus the covered mileage, the structural volume of the device can be kept to a bare minimum. It is possible to place the ampere-hour cell and the means controlled by the cell that might be additionally required for indicating the quantity of material converted by reaction into a customary mechanical or electric tachometer. A further reduction in the structural volume and in the price of the device can be accomplished in motor vehicles with an electric tachometer, such as are produced in growing numbers, by connecting the ampere-hour cell to the output circuit of the tachometer. This is so because a separate speed signal transmitter for the ampere-hour cell can in this case be omitted. Instead of an electrochemical ampere-hour cell, other ampere-hour indicator, particularly electromechanical ones, could be used, but the problems which form the base of the present invention cannot be solved, or can only be solved with substantial difficulty and expense, when such indicators are employed.\nIn a preferred embodiment, an ampere-hour cell constructed as a small incandescent lamp and filled with a liquid electrolyte is provided wherein, after a prespecified mileage has been covered, a color change of the electrolyte occurs. Such an ampere-hour cell has the advantage that it has particularly small outer dimensions, can be readily lodged in a tachometer or another motor vehicle instrument, and can be read with extreme ease. Since such an ampere-hour cell cannot be regenerated after the occurrence of the color change, in order to re-zero the device, the cell must be replaced when the service or inspection work for which a need is indicated is being carried out.\nWhen a device that produces an audible signal, or a light source is arranged, e.g., on the outside of the motor vehicle body at a place well visible from a distance so that it will automatically be switched on when the end of the prespecified mileage has been reached, it is advisable to use an embodiment provided with an electrolytic miniature cell. In this case, after a prespecified mileage has been reached, an unsteady resistance varation occurs and a threshold-value switch connected in series to the cell is operated, by means of which the device or the light source can be switched on. Although the expense for the electronics in such an embodiment is greater than in the one described above, this device can also be installed without difficulties in the tachometer or other motor-vehicle instrument. Especially for control of such an ampere-hour indicator by means of a number of pulses per unit of time proportional to the motor-vehicle speed, it is advisable to connect in series with the electrolytic miniature cell an integrating RC element by which the digital input signal is converted to an analog signal. By this device, expensive latching circuits in the output stage of the threshold value switch can be avoided. This device can also be used in other ampere-hour indicator if it should be required on account of the meter structure or for other reasons.\nIn another embodiment, an electrolytic miniature cell with two mercury electrodes mounted in a small tube and an electrolyte filling the space between them is provided. The electrolyte consists of an aqueous solution of an iodide salt and mercury iodide. The visible distance from one end of the small tube of the electrolyte changes proportionally to the mileage passed. Such a miniature cell, in comparison to the cells above described, has the advantage that a continuous signal is present, from which the driver of the motor vehicle can learn what mileage the motor vehicle can still cover before the service or inspection must be carried out, and which also shows the amount of mileage by which the service or inspection time was exceeded. A further advantage is that the cell can be regenerated, that is to say, when the device is being re-zeroed after the service or inspection work is carried out, the cell can be reutilized and need not be replaced.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\nThe invention will be explained in greater detail with the aid of the drawing which contains three embodiments.\nFig. 1 is a diagram of a device with an ampere-hour meter with a color conversion indication.\nFIG. 2 is a diagram of a device with an ampere-hour meter and with a threshold value switch connected in series to the ampere-hour meter.\nFIG. 3 is a diagram of a device with an ampere-hour meter which supplies a continuous signal.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\nThe apparatus 1 according to FIG. 1 contains an ampere-hour indicator or sensor 2, of a commercially available sort, shaped as an incandescent lamp and filled with an electrolyte 3 which, in the normal state, is of a yellow color. After a prespecified mileage has been covered, this color is changed to green. Ampere-hour indicator 2 is connected, by way of a high-resistance resistor 4 to the output circuit of a tachometer 5. By means of the resistance of resistor 4, the mileage to be covered before the ampere-hour indicator 2 changes its color can be prespecified. The longer mileage is the prespecified mileage tube covered, the greater is the resistance.\ntachometer 5 comprises a speed signal transmitter 6, which may be of an inductive, capacitive, galvanic, or other type and whose output is connected to the sensing input of a monostable flip flop 7, which receives the input signal pulses from transmitter 6 and generates output pulses of constant amplitude and constant length. The positive output of monostable flip-flop 7 is connected to a moving coil indicator, such as a D'Arsonval meter, which integrates the pulses on the basis of its inertia and indicates the prevailing traveling speed of the motor vehicle.\nIn the embodiment according to FIG. 2, the apparatus 1' contains a commercially available electrolytic miniature or sensor 9 whose internal resistance increases suddenly after the prespecified mileage has been covered, whereby the voltage drop across cell 9 suddenly increases. For the adjustment of the required mileage, a high-resistance-resistor 4 is used, as in the apparatus 1 of FIG. 1 described above. With respect to its resistance value, the statements made in connection with the apparatus described above are applicable. The variation in voltage drop at cell 9 controls a threshold value switch 10 whose output is connected to a signal lamp 11.\nDevice 1' is also controlled by electronic tachometer 5 mounted in the motor vehicle and, in contrast to the embodiment of FIG. 1, the rotary coil measuring mechanism 8 is in this case connected to the second output of the monostable flip-flop 7. Any reactive effects from the moving coil indicator 8 upon the control current are thereby safely eliminated. In order to avoid a pulsating voltage drop at cell 9, which results in a pulsating operation of threshold value switch 10 unless the latter is provided with a latching circuit, an integrating RC element 12 is connected in series to cell 9, which element transforms the digital output signal of monostable flip flop 7 into an analog signal.\nThe embodiment of FIG. 3 contains an apparatus 1\" with a commercially available electrolytic miniature cell or sensor 13. Miniature cell 13 consists of a small tube 14 with a sight glass and two mercury electrodes 15 and 16 mounted in the small tube 14 and separated by the electrolyte 17. Electrolyte 17 is an aqueous solution of an iodide salt and mercury iodide. When current passes through cell 13, mercury is electrolytically deposited at one of the mercury electrodes 15, while the other mercury electrode 16 is decomposed. Consequently, electrolyte 17 migrates slowly from one end of small tube 14 to the other, and migrates back at the reversal of the direction of the current. For reversing the direction of the current, a bipolar switch 18 is provided by means of which apparatus 11\" is attached to a speed signal transmitter 6. The adjustment of cell 13 to the required mileage is carried out by a high-resistance resistor 4, whose value is adjusted as discussed above.\nThe monostable flip-flop is also known as a monostable multivibrator. Electro-chemical ampere-hour indicators of the type disclosed are commercially available in the U.S. for instance from the firms Bissett-Berman, Los Angeles and Curtis Instruments Corporation, Montkisco, N.Y.\n", "claims": "\nWhat is claimed is:\n \n1.

Silver is precipitated on finely-divided tungsten carbide particles by reduction of a silver salt, and the tungsten carbide particles are thereby joined to form particles of larger grain size.", "background": "\nThis invention relates to a process for the manufacture of an electrode material containing silver and tungsten carbide for electrochemical cells, particularly fuel cells and storage cells.\nIt is known to employ tungsten carbide as a catalyst for the anodic oxidation of fuels, for instance, hydrogen, in fuel cells with an acidic electrolyte. Tungsten carbide may be made, for instance, by carburizing metallic tungsten with carbon, carbon black, or carbon-containing gases, such as carbon monoxide and methane, at temperatures above about 700\u00b0C. For the manufacture of bonded gas electrodes, tungsten carbide powder may be mixed with polymers as binders and pore-forming agents or with porous additives, such as activated carbon, and can be cold or hot molded (see \"Energy Conversion\", Vol. 10, pp. 25-28 (1970)).\nDifficulties are encountered in the manufacture of unbonded electrodes which contain the electrode or catalytic material in powder form. In the preparation of tungsten carbide from tungstic acid by reduction with hydrogen and carburation with carbon monoxide, for instance, the tungsten carbide thereby obtained has a mean particle size of less than about 1 micron; particles of larger diameter have too little surface area for electrode purposes in electrochemical cells. Employing particles of small diameter in powder electrodes leads to various difficulties. For one, the application of electrical contacts is a problem, as a conducting screen or fabric which is gas-permeable cannot be made economically and furthermore has pores so fine that the catalyst particles cannot get through the fabric into the gas chamber. On the other hand, the diameter of the pores (interstices) which form between the particles, depends on the size of the particles. Narrow pores between small particles develop high capillary pressures if they are filled with liquid, and the presence of a three-phase boundary can be created only by the use of very high gas pressures.\nThese difficulties are not present in bonded electrodes, because during the manufacture of such electrodes transport pores can be produced, by the introduction of pore-forming agents according to known methods, which are filled with gas even at low gas pressures and thereby readily permit the transport of the reaction gas to the point of the reaction. The use of organic binders, however, can have a detrimental effect, particularly in high-performance electrodes, since the binders have insulating properties and thereby impede the conduction of the current, and exclude a portion of the particles entirely from the conduction of the current, and hence from participation in the electrochemical process.\nGerman Offenlegungsschrift No. 1,939,127 describes a method for the manufacture of an electrode containing tungsten carbide for fuel cells in which the fine tungsten carbide particles are held together by silver, so that particles with a larger diameter are produced. For preparing the catalytic material, the silver salt of a tungstic acid, preferably silver metatungstate, is reduced and carburized at elevated temperature, whereby silver-containing tungsten carbide (Ag-WC) particles are formed. Such particles have a grain diameter approximately in the range of between about 10 and about 80 microns. The electrode material is distinguished by a high load capacity due to its advantageous structure; in addition to the diameter of the particles, which is well-suited for use in powder electrodes, the electrode material has a sufficiently large surface area, approximately in the range of 5 m2 /g (as determined by the BET method). In manufacturing larger quantities of electrode material, however, it is difficult to obtain uniform reproducibility which is particularly observable in the electrochemical properties of the product electrode.\nIt is an object of the invention to provide a simplified and further improved method for the manufacture of an electrode material containing silver and tungsten carbide for electrochemical cells, particularly fuel cells and storage cells. In addition, an electrode material having greater activity is obtained.\nThe electrode material prepared in accordance with the invention, which contains silver and tungsten carbide, exhibits a uniformly high electrochemical activity, and the reproducibility of the method is therefore established. In addition, the catalytic activity is increased over that of the electrode material prepared according to the above-described method; this can be observed, for instance, from the current-voltage characteristics of the electrode materials. Furthermore, the silver content in the end product may be varied within wide limits, whereas compared to the above-described method a reduction in silver content is particularly important, mainly for reasons of economy. Finally through the use of tungsten carbide as the starting material, it is also possible to conduct an intermediate check regarding the electrochemical activity of the product electrode material by determining the activity of the tungsten carbide so used.\nBroadly stated, the process comprises forming a suspension of finely-divided particles of tungsten carbide in an alkaline liquid, adding to said suspension a reducing agent capable of reducing silver ions in alkaline medium and also a silver salt, and thereafter separating from said suspension silver-coated tungsten carbide particles.\nIn a particularly preferred embodiment of the process, a suspension of tungsten carbide particles having a mean grain size of less than about 1 micron is suspended in an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide. To this suspension and while it is being vigorously agitated, a mixture of formaldehyde and an aqueous solution of silver nitrate is slowly added, preferably dropwise. The amount of silver in such solution is preferably sufficient to provide in the range of from about 10 to 20 weight percent metallic silver on the tungsten carbide particles. After completion of the reaction, the precipitate is separated from the supernatant liquid, washed and dried, from which one obtains silver-coated tungsten carbide particles in the range of 10 to about 80 microns. Further details of the process are explained in the following paragraphs.\nFor the reduction of the silver salt, formaldehyde may be advantageously employed, particularly as an aqueous solution (formalin). The best results are obtained with formaldehyde as the reducing agent. The reduction also may be performed, however, in a known manner with other reducing agents, such as hydrazine or hydroxylamine.\nSilver nitrate is preferably employed as the silver salt, but other soluble silver salts may be employed, for instance, silver acetate or silver fluoride. It is preferred to employ a weakly acidic aqueous solution of the silver salt. This avoids premature reduction of the silver, which occurs only in an alkaline environment. For this purpose the formaldehyde-silver nitrate solution is added slowly, e.g., dropwise to an alkaline suspension of tungsten carbide. Alternatively, the reducing agent and the silver salt solution may be added separately but concurrently to the suspension. The alkaline suspension is advantageously vigorously mixed during the addition of the silver salt solution and the reducing agent, because an electrode material with particularly high activity is thereby obtained. The reaction mixture may be cooled to dissipate the heat of reaction and to maintain the suspension at or below room temperature. The suspension may be made alkaline with a hydroxide, such as potassium or sodium hydroxide. In the process, the silver precipitates on the suspended tungsten carbide in the form of a gray-black deposit having a large surface area.\nThe ratio of silver to tungsten carbide in the finished electrode material may be varied within wide limits. Advantageously, however, the tungsten carbide and the silver salt are employed in such amounts that the silver content in the end product is about 10 to 20% by weight, and preferably about 15% by weight. An electrode material with a silver content in such range exhibits very good electro-catalytic properties. The electrode material has a grain size approximtely in the range of between about 10 and about 80 microns.\nThe invention will be explained in further detail with reference to an example of an embodiment and FIG. 1, which figure illustrates current-voltage characteristics of electrodes containing electrode material prepared in accordance with the invention.\nTungsten carbide is prepared as follows. 250 G of tungstic acid (H2 WO4) in powder form are reduced in a tube furnace in hydrogen flowing at approximately 100 liters/hour. The reduction takes place first at 540\u00b0C for 3 hours and subsequently at about 700\u00b0C for 2 hours. After the reduction is completed, the temperature is raised to about 860\u00b0C and the hydrogen is replaced by carbon monoxide flowing at about 200 liters/hour. The carburation is complete after about 4 hours. One obtains about 190 g of tungsten carbide with a mean grain size of less than 1 micron. In order to avoid oxidation (the tungsten carbide can be present as a pyrophorous powder), the material, which is cooled under a carbon monoxide atmosphere, can be suspended immediately in water. The tungsten carbide prepared in this manner is fabricated into a so-called supported electrode having a coating thickness of 20 mg/cm2. In a standard half-cell operated at room temperature (about 22\u00b0C) with a hydrogen pressure of 30 N/cm2, a 2.5 m H2 SO4 electrolyte and a polarization of 200 mV, the current yield is 0.25 A/gram of electrode material and the current density is 5 mA/cm2.\nElectrode material containing silver and tungsten carbide is prepared as follows. A suspension is made of 100 g of tungsten carbide in 140 ml of 6 n KOH. A mixture of 34 g AgNO3 in 200 ml of water and 40 ml of an aqueous 35% formaldehyde solution (formalin) is added slowly, dropwise, to such suspension over the course of about 1 hour. While adding the drops, the reaction mixture is stirred vigorously and the reaction temperature is held between about 15\u00b0 and 20\u00b0C by cooling with ice. After the reduction of silver is complete, the precipitate formed is allowed to settle and the supernatant clear liquid is decanted.\nThe precipitate is washed with water until the wash water reacts neutral. Then the residual water is removed under suction, the moist material is suspended in methanol and the methanol is decanted. Subsequently, the electrode material obtained is dried for about 2 hours in a drying cabinet at a temperature of about 110\u00b0C, whereby a finely-divided gray-black powder is obtained.\nThe electrode material prepared in this manner, having a grain size in the range between about 10 and 80 microns, is fabricated into a supported electrode having an electrode area of 12.5 cm2. To this end, sufficient electrode material is deposited on a layer of asbestos paper, which may contain a binder, to furnish a coating of about 200 mg/cm2. The coating of electrode material is covered on the gas side with a carbon fabric which supports the coating and serves to make electrical contact. On the electrolyte side, the asbestos layer is supported by a perforated tantalum sheet.\nThe catalytic activity of such an electrode was tested in a half-cell arrangement, a gold sheet serving as the counterelectrode. An electrolyte of 2.5 m H2 SO4 at a temperature of 22\u00b0C was used as the electrolyte liquid; hydrogen at different operating pressures served as the reaction gas. An Hg/Hg2 SO4 electrode in the same electrolyte was used as the reference electrode.\nThe results obtained in the investigations are depicted in FIG. 1 as current-voltage characteristics, current density in mA/cm2 versus the polarization (\u03b7) in mV, measured against the Hg/Hg2 SO4 reference electrode. The characteristics were obtained on electrodes with a coating thickness of 200 mg/cm2. Curve 11 was recorded at a hydrogen pressure of 15 N/cm2 ; curves 12 and 13 at a hydrogen pressure of 20 and 25 N/cm2, respectively.\nAs may be seen from curve 12, a current density of about 23 mA/cm2 is obtained with the electrode material prepared in accordance with the invention, with a coating of 200 mg/cm2 and an operating pressure of 20 N/cm2 and with a polarization of 200 mV; from this, the calculated current yield is about 0.11 ampere per gram of catalytically active electrode material. Referred to tungsten carbide alone, the current yield is even greater, since the catalytic material contains silver. An important advantage of the electrode material prepared in accordance with the invention, as compared to pure tungsten carbide, is that electrodes made with it attain their optimum performance characteristic at lower hydrogen pressures; with pure tungsten carbide, an operating pressure of about 30 N/cm2 is required.\nThe attainable current density increases with increasing operating pressure. With a polarization of 200 mV, the current density is about 29 mA/cm2 (curve 13) at a hydrogen pressure of 25 N/cm2. With a hydrogen pressure of 15 N/cm2, on the other hand, the current density attainable with the same polarization in only about 8 mA/cm2 (curve 11).\nIn addition to fuel cells and storage cells, the electrode material prepared in accordance with the invention may also be employed in other electrochemical cells, particularly for electro-synthesis and electrolysis. If used in storage cells, the electro-catalyst prepared in accordance with the invention is particularly useful as the electrode material in the indicator and consumable electrodes in gastight storage cells, because in such cells provision must be made for preventing the gases which may be generated due to overcharging, and are generated during discharging, from exerting an excessively high pressure. In order to achieve this, the capacity of the positive electrode is, for instance, selected to be larger than that of the negative electrode, so that in case of overcharging, hydrogen develops first at the negative electrode (2 H2 O + 2 e- \u2192 H2 + 2 OH-). In principle, two means of prevention are known. First, a so-called consumable electrode may be incorporated into the storage cell, at which the hydrogen which may be generated is electrochemically reacted and is brought into solution again. Secondly, the storage cell may comprise a so-called indicator electrode which is catalytically active and sets up the reversible hydrogen potential under the action of hydrogen. This potential, which is measured against a reference electrode, may then by used as a control signal to terminate the charging process. The electrode material prepared in accordance with the invention can be used for both kinds of the auxiliary electrodes mentioned, i.e., the consumable electrodes and the indicator electrodes.\n", "claims": "\nHaving thus described the invention, what is claimed is:\n \n1.

This goal has been partially achieved in nickel-cadmium cells through the operation of such cells on the oxygen overcharge principle. The electrodes employed in this system are so designed that only oxygen is evolved on overcharge. The oxygen thus produced oxidizes the metal anode, thereby effectively preventing excessive gas pressure within the cell.\nWhile the oxygen overcharge system is advantageous in that it makes possible a sealed battery, there are several inherent problems which limit its applications. For example, the anode must be made of a material which reacts rapidly with oxygen and the cathode material is limited to compounds which do not deteriorate on repeated overcharging and which do not form soluble materials on overcharge. In addition, the applications of this system are limited to rechargeable cell systems employing expensive components and there is no efficient way of recombining the hydrogen gas generated by corrosion in the normal course of battery use.\nIt has been proposed, to remove the hydrogen gas evolved during cell discharge, to utilize the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen to form water. In some battery systems, for example, a third electrode has been inserted to combine the hydrogen and oxygen produced during discharge. In the lead-acid battery system, palladium or platinum metal has been used to catalyze the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen to form water. Neither of these solutions has been completely satisfactory since the amounts of hydrogen and oxygen gas formed are not necessarily the stoichiometric amounts which will react to form water without leaving unreacted gas in the system. If there is unreacted hydrogen gas in the system, the internal pressure in sealed cells may increase to dangerously high levels or may lead to seal rupture.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nAccording to the present invention there is provided a method and device which will prevent buildup of unreacted hydrogen gas in sealed cells. More particularly there is provided a hydrogen gas absorbing device comprising a discrete shaped body containing a material which will react chemically with hydrogen gas, a catalyst for the hydrogen gas consuming reaction and a binder which is compatible with the other materials and will maintain them in a shaped body which is permeable to hydrogen gas. The shaped body is preferably packaged in a material which is permeable to hydrogen gas but impermeable to the cell electrolyte throughout the life of the cell.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\nFIG. 1 is a stylized cross-sectional view of a commercial manganese dioxide-zinc alkaline battery but containing, in addition to conventional components, a hydrogen absorbing device in accordance with the present invention; and\nFIG. 2 is a stylized cross-sectional view of a carbonzinc LeClanche battery containing a ring-shaped hydrogen absorbing device in accordance with the present invention.\nReferring to the drawings in more detail, there is shown in FIG. 1 a manganese dioxide-zinc alkaline battery generally designated 10 having a gelled anode 12 of powdered zinc, a semi-rigid tubular current collector 14 of brass, a manganese dioxide cathode 16, and an alkaline potassium hydroxide electrolyte 18 contained within the current collector 14 and throughout the gelled anode 12.\nThe inner components of the cell are enclosed in a cupped metallic can 20 surrounded by a metal jacket 22 which is electrically insulated from the can by an insulating jacket 24. The extremities of the insulating jacket 24 and the metal jacket 22 are crimped around the outer edges of a top metal cover 26 and an outer bottom metal cover 28. An insulator 30 electrically insulates the can 20 from the outer bottom metal cover 28. The cathode is snugly fitted within can 20 and is lined with a separator basket 32 of a non-woven fabric of regenerated cellulose and vinyl chloride. The current collector 14, the electrolyte 18 and the gelled anode 12 are separated from the top of can 20 (which may have a thin layer of cathode mix thereon) by the top of the separator basket 32. A hydrogen absorbing pellet, generally designated 34, is positioned within the hollow core of current collector 14 and comprises a mixture of a compound which will react with hydrogen gas, a catalyst for this hydrogen consuming reaction and a suitable porous binder holding the reactant and catalyst in the desired shape. The pellet is generally cylindrical in shape and is coated with a layer of hydrogen gas permeable but electrolyte impermeable film 36 which protects the pellet from chemical attack by the electrolyte. The composition and method of fabricating the pellet will be described in greater detail hereinafter.\nSuitably, the cell closure for this cell is of the type disclosed and claimed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,042,734. Such a closure comprises an inner metal bottom 38 secured to the cathode 16 by means of seal 40. A rivet provides a tight mechanical connection between current collector 14 and inner metal bottom 38 but is electrically insulated from the inner metal bottom by seal 40. A pressure spring 44 is provided in electrical contact with rivet 42 and outer metal bottom 28 to establish and maintain contact between current collector 14 and outer metal bottom 28.\nDuring the cell reaction, any hydrogen gas which may be generated will diffuse through the gelled anode and electrolyte and will contact the hydrogen absorbing pellet. The gas will penetrate the membrane covering the pellet, contact the reactant in the presence of the catalyst and react chemically to form a solid product.\nIn commercially available manganese dioxide-zinc alkaline battery systems, the gelled anode is usually amalgamated powdered zinc held together with gelled electrolyte in which the gelling agent is a material such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose. A substantial amount of mercury is included to reduce the wasteful zinc corrosion and thereby prevent hydrogen gas evolution. By including the hydrogen absorbing device of the present invention is alkaline batteries, a sealed battery can be produced in which the amount of mercury present in the cell can be reduced since the hydrogen gas formed during the cell reaction will be removed by the hydrogen absorbing device. This improvement results in a battery which is completely sealed and costs less to manufacture than manganese dioxide-zinc alkaline batteries presently commercially available.\nFIG. 2 shows an embodiment of the invention wherein a LeClanche round cell is adapted to make efficient use of a hydrogen absorbing device in accordance with the present invention. The round cell, generally designated 50, employs the usual carbon rod cathode collector 52 and manganese dioxide-carbon cathode depolarizer mix 54 separated from a zinc can 56 by a separator 58. A metal closure plate 60, for example a leadplated steel member, is provided in electrical contact with the bottom of the zinc can to avoid leakage if the zinc is perforated during discharge. The zinc can 56 is encased in a standard plastic jacket 62 which is sealed to contact plate 60 at the bottom of the cell and to a plastic top 64 at the top of the cell. These seals can be made air tight and thereby provide a cell system which is completely sealed and leak-proof. The carbon rod cathode collector 52 extends through the plastic top 64 and is capped with a metal cover 66 which acts as the positive terminal for the cell. The depolarizer mix 54 is formed in a manner such that an air space 67 is left between the top of the depolarizer and the plastic top 64. A hydrogen absorbing device 68 coated with a plastic film 70 is positioned above the cathode depolarizer mix 54 and acts, in the same manner as the pellet of FIG. 1, to absorb any hydrogen gas which is liberated during the shelf life or discharge of the battery. In this embodiment, however, the hydrogen gas absorbing device is ring-shaped to conform to the available air space 67 above the cathode depolarizer mix 54.\nThe hydrogen gas evolved during the shelf life of a cell can be easily absorbed by the ring-shaped absorber. However, under abuse conditions, such as a continuous electrical short circuit between the anode and the cathode, hydrogen gas will be generated on the carbon surface in the cathode mix as long as unused zinc remains. In order to avoid this situation, the amount of zinc should preferably be limited to much less than the cathode capacity. This accounts for the possibility of perforation of the zinc can at the bottom of the cell and necessities the inclusion of the closure plate 60.\nIt can be seen from the foregoing discussion that the hydrogen absorbing device of the present invention is adaptable to various shapes and sizes of cell structures and is useful in a wide variety of battery constructions where hydrogen gas evolution is a problem. The hydrogen absorbing device can be included in individual cells, in a sealed package containing a series of cells, or in any closed container where hydrogen gas absorption is desirable.\nHydrogen absorbing devices in accordance with the present invention have three essential components: a substance which will react with hydrogen gas, a catalyst, for the hydrogen oxidation reaction, and a binder which will maintain the reactant and catalyst as an integral unit. Preferably, the device will also have an external coating to prevent contamination of the reactant and catalyst by cell components or by-products of the cell reaction.\nThe material which will react with the hydrogen gas can be any solid compound which will react with or oxidize hydrogen to yield a solid or liquid reaction product. Specifically, suitable materials are those which, at ordinary ambient temperature, will exhibit a negative free energy change (\u0394F) associated with the reaction of that material with hydrogen. Preferred reactants include manganese oxides such as manganese dioxide (MnO2), manganic oxide (Mn2 O3), manganese hydroxide (MnOOH) and hausmannite (Mn3 O4), cupric oxide, silver oxide, mercuric oxide, manganese phosphate, bismuth trioxide, m-dinitrobenzene and quinone. Of these, manganese dioxide is particularly preferred since it is a relatively inexpensive and readily available material, and its properties and predictability in battery systems are well established.\nA catalyst for the hydrogen consuming reaction is necessary since, while each of the above compounds will react spontaneously with hydrogen, the reaction will not take place at ordinary ambient temperature at a rate sufficient to insure that hydrogen gas will be absorbed from the system before the internal pressure causes rupture of the battery seal. The need for a catalyst is dramatized by the fact that, although the vast majority of batteries presently produced contain large amounts of manganese dioxide, the buildup of unreacted hydrogen gas is still the major problem in obtaining completely sealed batteries. The preferred catalysts include the so-called \"noble metal\" or the platinum family of metals which make up Group VIII of the Periodic Table. Suitable noble metals which may be used in the practice of this invention are palladium, platinum and rhodium. Of these, palladium is preferred since it has a natural tendency itself to absorb and hold hydrogen gas on its surface and would act to retain the gas in the vicinity of the reactant until the reaction between the gas and the reactant can take place. Particularly preferred is a material known as palladium catalyzed carbon which contains about 5 per cent palladium metal on a substrate of carbon particles. In addition to the noble metals themselves, compounds of Group VIII metals may also be used. Illustrative of such compounds are nickel boride and Raney nickel.\nThe binder for the system should be one which will retain the reactant and catalyst in the desired geometric shape which will be porous to hydrogen gas to allow the gas to circulate through the pellet and contact the surface of the reactant and catalyst. The binder can be organic or inorganic material and need only possess the desired physical properties. Powdered synthetic organic polymers, e.g., polyethylene, and natural condensation polymers, e.g., starch, are suitable for use as binders in the devices of the present invention. A preferred binder is an inorganic cement such as Portland cement. This binder is preferred since the cement provides sufficient strength and porosity and yet does not contaminate or poison the metal catalyst. Acetylene black can be added to improve the conductivity of the pellet and to provide the device with the maximum number of hydrogen gas permeable channels to enable the gas to penetrate to the interior of the device and make efficient use of the reactant and catalyst contained therein. In addition, the use of acetylene black and other electrochemically inactive components, e.g., steel wool fibers, in the binder increases the strength of the device and permits a substantial reduction in the amount of catalyst necessary to allow the reaction to proceed at a desirable rate. Other physical properties of the device, e.g., specific gravity, can also be altered by proper selection of additives and use of the proper amounts thereof. For example, the conductive material (carbon) can be selected to have a specific gravity such that the pellet will float in the cell electrolyte and thus be automatically situated at the juction between the electrolyte and the air space in the cell where hydrogen formed can accumulate. A low density carbon or graphite powder is an example of such a material which can be conveniently used to prepare a floating pellet.\nThe hydrogen absorbing device of the present invention can be fabricated in several ways, depending upon the binder which is employed. When the binder is cement, it is merely necessary to mix the powdered reactant, catalyst and inactive fillers, if any, with the wet cement and mold the resulting mixture into the desired shape. Excess water or other solvent is then evaporated leaving a hard, dry, shaped body. The same procedure can be followed with other binders, for example, powdered resins. In such cases, however, a suitable organic solvent such as toluene or benzene would be used.\nAfter the device is shaped and dried, it is preferably covered entirely with a thin plastic film to protect it from penetration by electrolyte or other liquid materials in the cell. The film used should be permeable to hydrogen gas but impermeable to liquids. The film can be applied by any of the conventional methods of application including dissolving the film material in an organic solvent, spraying the solution on the pellet and evaporating the solvent; dissolving the film material in an inorganic solvent, dipping the pellet into the solution and evaporating the solvent from the surface of the pellet; wrapping the pellet in the film and heat shrinking the film to provide a tightly sealed, wet proof, hydrogen permeable covering; or heat sealing the pellet in an extruded tube of the selected film material. Any hydrogen gas permeable and liquid impermeable film can be used to protect the devices of the present invention. Particularly useful films include polyethylene, copolymers of polyvinyl chloride and polyvinylidene chloride, polystyrene, ethyl cellulose and polyethylene terephthalate. Of these, the polyethylene films in thicknesses of 0.5 to 2.5 mils are preferred, heat shrunk around the pellet since they provide a very tight, strong skin which is highly permeable to hydrogen gas.\nThe following examples are merely illustrative of the present invention and are not intended, in any way, to be limitative thereof:\nEXAMPLE I\nInto a ball mill were placed, in the dry state, 160 grams of electrolytic manganese dioxide powder, 1 gram of palladium coated carbon powder (5 per cent palladium on carbon), 2 grams of acetylene black, 80 grams of Portland cement, and 5 grams of steel wool chopped to 1/8 inch lengths. These components were mixed thoroughly in the ball mill for about 30 minutes. At the end of this time 16 grams of the dry mixture were placed in a beaker to which a few drops of 9 molar potassium hydroxide and, subsequently, 7 milliliters of distilled water were added to make a spreadable paste. After being well blended, the paste was filled into half-moon shaped channels 11/2 inch in length and 3/16 inch in diameter cut in a Lucite block. The paste-filled block was oven-dried at 45\u00b0C.-65\u00b0C. for 40 minutes and the pellets were removed from the block and further dried in air overnight at room temperature. The average weight of each pellet was 1.3 grams of which 0.85 gram was manganese dioxide. The formed pellets were wrapped in a layer of heat-shrinkable polyethylene film about one to two mils thick. The film was then heat shrunk around the pellet and the edges of the film were heat sealed using a hot air blower set at 130\u00b0C.\nThese pellets could absorb up to 220 cubic centimeters of hydrogen gas at standard temperature and pressure and, when placed inside the current collector of rechargeable D-size alkaline manganese dioxide cells, in the manner shown in FIG. 1, substantially improved the high temperature storage capacity of the cells such that no cell rupture occured after 14 weeks storage at 71\u00b0C. Fifty per cent of control cells containing no hydrogen absorbing pellet ruptured after similar storage.\nEXAMPLE II\nTo determine the effects of variation in the level of catalyst content, various hydrogen absorbent compositions were prepared following the basic formula set forth in the following table:\n\n               TABLE I______________________________________Formula A            WeightComponent        (g)         Percentage______________________________________Electrolytic     160         64.5manganese dioxide powderAcetylene black  2           0.8Portland cement  80          32.3Steel Wool       5           2.05 per cent palladium            1           0.4catalyzed carbon______________________________________\nThe amount of palladium catalyst in Formula A was varied to yield Formulas B, C, D, E, and F containing 2.0, 5.0, 10.0, 25.0, and 50.0 grams, respectively, of 5 per cent palladium catalyzed carbon. The amount of hydrogen absorbed and the absorption rate of each formula are set forth in Table 2.\n\n                                   TABLE 2__________________________________________________________________________Effect of Catalyst Content onHydrogen Absorption Rate at 45\u00b0C.

The brass collector becomes amalgamated upon contact with the anode. To determine the effect of including the hydrogen absorbing device of the present invention in cells containing reduced amounts of mercury, several tightly sealed C-size cells were prepared containing different amounts of said mercury with and without hydrogen absorbing pellets in the cathode collector. The cells were completed except for the outer finishing components, i.e., metal jacket and outer top and bottom covers. These cells were stored at 45\u00b0C. for 150 days. At the end of this time, the \"bottom bulge\" of the cells, that is, the mechanical deflection of the flat end of the steel can, shown at the top of FIG. 1, was measured as an indication of the amount of unabsorbed hydrogen gas present in the cell. The measurement of the bulge of the bottom of the cell gives a good indication of the amount of gas present in the cell since the flat bottom of the cell is relatively easily deflected and is the first portion of the cell to yield to gas pressure. The results of this test are tabulated in Table 3.\n\n               TABLE 3______________________________________Bottom Bulge of Cells with VaryingAmounts of Mercury______________________________________              Bottom BulgeComposition         (inch)______________________________________2% mercury (no pellet)              0.023 (ruptured)2% mercury (with pellet)              0.0134% mercury (no pellet)              0.023 (ruptured)4% mercury (with pellet)              0.0118% mercury (no pellet)              0.0188% mercury (with pellet)              0.011______________________________________\nFrom Table 3 it can be seen that the cells containing hydrogen absorbing pellets in accordance with the present invention had considerably less bottom bulge at the end of the 150 days storage period and none of the cells containing hydrogen absorbing pellets ruptured during the test. It can also be seen that cells with 2 percent mercury containing a pellet were better than those with 8 percent mercury and no pellet. This reduction in mercury content represents a substantial saving in the cost of producing the cells since mercury is one of the most expensive ingredients used in the alkaline zinc-manganese dioxide cell system.\nWhile the use of the hydrogen gas absorbing device of the present invention has been described specifically for use in battery systems, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the device has utility wherever hydrogen gas absoption is desired. Examples of such applications are liquid level switches, underwater mines and sealed capacitors where hydrogen gas buildup is undesirable and has been a cause of system malfunction. Moreover, while the present invention has been described with reference to many particular details thereof, it is not intended that these details shall be construed as limiting the scope of this invention.\n", "claims": "\nWhat is claimed is:\n \n1.

No. 237,061 filed Mar. 21, 1972 now U.S. Pat. 3,865,744.\nThis invention relates to methods of separating and recovering copper from materials containing copper and of preparing purer forms of copper, via solutions of certain cuprous salts in acidified mixtures of water and organic nitriles. The invention includes methods for preparing solutions of copper salts of compositions which are useful for copper recovery or copper purification. Further details of organic nitriles and cuprous salts are given later in this application.\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\nConventional methods of extracting and refining copper are described by A. Butts in \"Copper the Metal its Alloys and Compounds\" Reinhold Publishing Corp., New York, 1954. The most common method is pyrometallurgy through flotation of crushed ore, then smelting in an oxidising atmosphere to blister and anode copper, and finally electrorefining of anodic to cathodic copper, via acidic cupric sulphate solutions. This method has the disadvantages of pollution by sulphur dioxide, high capital and operating costs and losses of valuable materials in fumes and slags. Another method is that of hydrometallurgy, i.e. leaching copper oxides or sulphides with sulphuric acid, sometimes in the presence of ferric sulphate, to give cupric sulphate solutions. Copper itself can be dissolved in hot sulphuric acid under oxidising conditions to give cupric sulphate solutions. In these methods the cupric sulphate solutions are then stripped of their copper by electrowinning or cementation. More recent procedures include treating the ore with an oxidising or reducing roast, the TORCO segregation process, bacterial leaching, and leaching with ferric chloride or ammoniacal solutions. All these processes, require a final step of electrorefining or electrowinning via aqueous acidified cupric sulphate solutions, if one is to produce copper of sufficient purity for many commercial processes. The electrorefining step is a slow process, typical tankhouse cycles being 11-14 days. A number of tankhouse staff are needed, handling of anodes, treatment of slimes, attention to short circuits and cathode quality, all create problems. The electrowinning process is also slow and consumes considerable quantities of power, but costs associated with anode handling are reduced, compared to electrorefining.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nIt is a main object of this invention to provide a composition of matter suitable for processing copper via cuprous ions and which comprises a composition of matter comprising at least 15% by volume water, an acid selected from the group consisting of sulphuric, sulphurous and nitric acid, at least 4% by volume of an organic nitrile and a copper salt of the corresponding acid.\nVarios other objects, advantages, methods of using the compositions and explanation of terms will become apparent from the detailed description and discussion of preferred embodiments which appear hereinafter.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT\nSome preferred aspects of the invention are described with reference to the drawings. However, it is to be understood that the drawings are diagrammatic only and are not intended to be limitative of the invention. In the drawings:\nFIG. 1 illustrates the layout of a system including an electrochemical disproportionation cell from which anolyte is removed and after treatment returned to the cell. This system is suitable for copper powder electrorefining.\nFIG. 2 illustrates a modification of FIG. 1 and relates to copper powder electrorefining.\nFIG. 3 illustrates the layout of apparatus for use in electrochemical disproportionation and in particular a design of the cells, plus a circuit illustrating the method of cuprous electrowinning.\nFIG. 4 illustrates the layout of a system for cuprous winning.\nFIG. 5 illustrates the layout of a system suitable for continuous copper powder refining.\nFIG. 6 summarizes and illustrates methods of generating cuprous salt solutions, their purification, methods for their disproportionation to cupric salt solutions and copper and methods of converting the cupric salt solutions to cuprous salt solutions.\nFIG. 7 is a flowsheet illustrating the separation of copper and silver from materials containing those metals.\nThe overall field of this invention is illustrated in FIG. 6 (explained in detail hereinafter) and involves methods of producing solutions of certain cuprous salts in acidified mixtures of sufficient of suitable organic nitriles and water. This is followed by two methods of disproportionating the cuprous salt to copper and cupric salt either electrochemically or by thermally removing the nitrile from the solution. The cupric salt which is produced by disproportionation is then converted to cuprous salt by reduction with copper or reaction with other suitable substances and the process continues. Reduction of Cu2 + by copper is a method of copper refining, reduction by other reducing agents is a method of copper winning from cuprous solutions and reaction with cuprous or cupric sulphide is a method of leaching by oxidising the sulphide.\nThe reactions which produce cuprous salts are with one exception reactions between solids and reagents in solution, and as such have the usual advantages when performed with well agitated, finely divided solids at elevated temperatures if possible. The use of volatile hydrolyzable nitriles in aqueous acidified solutions and of oxidisable cuprous ions imposes limitations and it is desirable to operate whenever possible in sealed systems in the absence of significant amounts of oxygen.\nSome of the methods described are named for the purposes of identification in this application as cuprous electrowinning, cuprous winning, copper powder electrorefining and copper powder refining, but it will be apparent from FIG. 6 that the four processes are very closely linked. Thus a cupric solution from the anolyte of copper powder electrorefining could be used to oxidise copper produced by thermal disproportionation and thus covert the powder to cathodic copper.\nThe field of this application can be further summarized as:\na. Methods and compositions for producing cuprous salt solutions from slightly soluble cuprous or cupric salts.\nb. Methods and compositions for leaching copper, from materials containing copper and insoluble impurities, as cuprous salt solutions.\nc. Methods and compositions for reducing solutions of cupric salts to solutions of cuprous salts.\nd. Methods of electrochemically disproportionating cuprous salt solutions to copper and cupric salt solutions in the presence of soluble impurities.\ne. Methods of thermally disproportionating cuprous salt solutuions to copper and cupric salt solutions in the presence of soluble impurities.\nf. Linking these concepts in a variety of ways, as sketched in FIG. 6, to give new processes for producing purer forms of copper metal from materials containing copper, cupric ions, or cuprous ions. Some of these ways are described e.g. as cuprous electrowinning, copper powder refining, but we do not exclude other methods of processing copper e.g. leaching of cuprous sulphide by Cu2 + , which link together the five embodiments (a) - (e), and are shown in FIG. 6 but are not given a new defined name.\nFor example, a solution of cuprous sulphide could be treated with cupric sulphate to give a cuprous solution. This is then thermally disproportionated to copper and cupric sulphate. The copper is then dissolved by an anolyte from a cell in which electrochemical disproportionation is taking place and deposited as cathodic copper in that cell. The cupric sulphate from the thermal disproportionation is reacted with atomised blister copper to give a cuprous sulphate solution and this is again thermally disproportionated, but this time the cupric sulphate solution is not recombined with the nitrile distillate, rather a higher boiling nitrile is added, the CuSO4 is reduced with iron to cuprous sulphate and the solution is then electrochemically disproportionated.\nThe methods are all different from the current methods for extracting copper and or recovering purer copper, from materials containing copper or from solutions containing copper salts. Specific details, such as compositions of solvents, methods of preparing solutions, nature of nitriles and reductants, and notional design of equipment, are presented later in the application, together with examples illustrating some of the applications of the methods.\nProcesses Based on Electrochemical Disproportionation Copper Powder Electrorefining and Cuprous Electrowinning\nIn one sense the division of methods is artificial because in both, cuprous sulphate or bisulphate is disproportionated electrochemically to give cathodic copper using an inert anode in a more or less conventional way, with an electrolyte composed of cuprous sulphate or CuHSO4 in water, an organic nitrile and sulphuric acid, plus additives, such as glue and sodium alkylaryl sulphonates, designed to improve the quality of the cathodic deposit. The anolyte, containing cupric sulphate, is removed continuously and is replaced by fresh cuprous sulphate electrolyte. The division of methods is based on what is done with the anolyte containing cupric sulphate.\nIn the preferred form of copper powder electrorefining, the anolyte is reacted with copper, or materials containing copper, preferably in a finely divided state and preferably containing a high (> 99%) proportion of copper, when reaction 1 of FIG. 6 occurs. Other possible reactions (3, 8 and 10 of FIG. 6) with suitable materials may occur if these are also present in the copper, all of which produce cuprous salt solutions. The species M of reaction 8 are reductants which are often present in the copper containing material, e.g. iron or nickel. Such species usually pass into the electrolyte as soluble oxidation products (e.g. salts of Fe2 + and Ni2 +). Inert components of the copper containing materials, such as gold, silver, lead, silica, bauxite and carbonaceous material form a \"slime\". Basic impurities react with acid in the electrolyte. The dissolution of Cu2 O by H2 SO4 to form extra cuprous sulphate and eventually cupric sulphate as well as air oxidation of CU+, help to balance losses of Cu SO4 due to reducing agents in the copper. The cuprous sulphate solution produced by these reactions replaces the anolyte in the electrochemical cell, after any necessary treatment, such as filtration, removal of soluble impurities and adjustment of acid and cuprous levels.\nIn the preferred form of cuprous electrowinning, the solution of cuprous sulphate which replaces the anolyte containing cupric sulphate is produced by any suitable method, but the anolyte containing cupric sulphate is not reduced with copper or materials containing copper, although it may be reduced by other reducing agents such as iron (reaction 8 of FIG. 6).\nThe distinction between the two methods is used because in copper powder electrorefining the process is effectively transferring copper from \"powdered\" materials containing copper to a purer form on a cathode, whereas in cuprous electrowinning, only 50% of the copper initially is being electrowon from a solution of cuprous sulphate, but subsequent reductions of CuSO4 then effectively increase this recovery of cathodic copper.\nAs noted, the electrolytic part of the process is very like that for conventional electrowinning of copper from aqueous cupric sulphate solutions (cf. Butts loc. cit) except that the electrolyte is different and anolyte must be removed and replaced by fresh cuprous electrolyte. Anodes coated with lead oxide are not \"inert\" to cuprous solutions and so are not suitable inert anodes. Lead lined vessels are suitable containers, but precautions may have to be taken to contain volatile nitriles and minimise oxidation by air. With most inert anodes, e.g. carbon, it has been found that there are substantial advantages of lower operating voltage in having good circulation of electrolyte past the anode, but with other, more expensive anodes, e.g. platinum, we find that the degree of circulation has less effect on the operating voltage. Cathode quality is improved at lower operating temperatures, but the operating voltage is higher, so that a balance between these factors is needed. An operating temperature of between 20\u00b0 and 45\u00b0C is preferred. High temperatures (e.g. > 50\u00b0C) encourage loss of nitrile by hydrolysis.\nThe electrode reactions are believed to be :\n\n Cu.sup.+ + e.sup.- \u2192 Cu at the cathode\n\n Cu.sup.+ \u2192 Cu.sup.2.sup.+ + e.sup.- at the anode\nThe cupric sulphate, which is produced at the anode in increasing quantities as reaction proceeds, reduces the efficiency of the process, because it dissolves copper from the cathode to a limited extent and more seriously, because of the electrode process Cu2 + + e- \u2192 Cu+ at the cathode. Thus, cupric sulphate should be prevented from reaching the cathode in significant amounts. As noted, this is best done by continuously replacing anolyte with fresh cuprous sulphate electrolyte.\nCopper powder electrorefining offers a new way of converting impure particulate copper to purer cathodic copper without casting anodes. Anode handling is simplified and being a one electron process, power consumption per pound of copper is low, although slightly higher than \"cupric refining\" of copper anodes.\nWithout removal of CuSO4, the electrochemical disproportionation proceeds satisfactorily for only about 10% recovery of copper. After this, the efficiency drops rapidly.\nPrecautions should be taken to minimise oxidation and to contain volatile, toxic and inflammable nitriles and there are advantages in using a high boiling water soluble nitrile, such as 2-hydroxycyanoethane under an inert atmosphere although voltages are higher than with an equivalent mole proportion of acetonitrile.\nTwo of the methods for semi-continuous operation of copper powder electrorefining are outlined in FIGS. 1 and 2. The method of FIG. 1 is preferred. In FIGS. 1 and 2, representing two possible methods of copper powder refining the numerals represent: 1 - an inert anode e.g. of carbon, 2 - a copper cathode, 3 - a power supply, 4 - a cuprous sulphate, sulphuric acid, water, organic nitrile electrolyte, with or without additives, 5 - an electrolysis vessel, preferably covered with the electrolyte under a non-oxidising atmosphere, 6 - a pipe for transferring anolyte containing couric sulphate, 7 - a reaction vessel, 8 - a system for removing insoluble slimes, 9 - a system for adding copper containing materials, preferably of high copper content, 10 - a system for removing solids from the electrolyte, 11 - a pump for circulating electrolyte, 12 - a system for bleeding off electrolyte for purification and/or adjustment of composition, 13 - a system for electrolyte purification, 14 - a system for removing impurities e.g. ferrous sulphate, extracted from the electrolyte in 13, 15 - a pipeline for returning the cuprous sulphate sulphuric acid, water and organic nitrile electrolyte with or without additives to the electrolysis vessel. The preferred requirement for such a method is that, in conjunction with a more or less conventional electrowinning cell (5), in which copper is being electrowon from the specified well agitated cuprous sulphate solutions (4), by more or less conventional methods, the anolyte containing cupric sulphate be continuously removed (6) from the vicinity of the electrodes (1) and replaced by cuprous sulphate solution (15), which has been generated as in reaction 1 of FIG. 6 by passing the anolyte over suitable finely divided material containing copper in reaction vessel (7), at such a speed that the copper dissolves as cuprous sulphate and the concentration of cupric sulphate in the cell is kept preferably below 10% of the total copper in solution. There should be provision (8) for extracting slimes, for excluding insolubles (10) from the electrolytic part of the cell and provision for removal of soluble impurities (12, 13, 14) (e.g. FeSO4, NiSO4) from the electrolyte by diversion of the electrolyte.\nThe electrochemical process, irrespective of the nature of the replacement of anolyte by Cu2 SO4 solution, operates preferably at a current density of 5-30 amps/sq.ft, more preferably 5-20, but for the method outlined in FIG. 1, the current density, the total anode area, the rate of flow of anolyte, and the rate of reaction between Cu and CuSO4 should be coordinated to keep the concentration of CuSO4 in the cell at an acceptable level. Coordination can also be influenced by varying the temperature of operation, preferably between 20 and 55\u00b0C and the size of the copper containing material.\nIn cuprous electrowinning one form of which is illustrated by FIG. 3 it is necessary to include a reducing cycle to reduce the anolyte and return it to the cell as cuprous sulphate, with if necessary, prior removal of the oxidation products of the reductant. With iron for example as reductant, the process is very closely related to copper powder electrorefining because the reactions in the reducing circuit are thought to be as follows :\nInitially, with excess iron:\n\n Cu.sup.2.sup.+ + Fe \u2192 Cu + Fe.sup.2.sup.+\nWith more Cu2 + :\n\n Cu.sup.2.sup.+ + Cu \u2192 2 Cu.sup.+\nOverall:\n\n 2Cu.sup.2.sup.+ + Fe \u2192 2 Cu.sup.+ + Fe.sup.2.sup.+\nSuch a cuprous solution can replace the anolyte, preferably after removal of some of the ferrous sulphate. Other methods of reduction or of converting cupric sulphate to cuprous sulphate are outlined in FIG. 6 and are described in detail later.\nCompared with the conventional electrowinning of cupric solutions in water, the electrochemical disproportionations just described proceed at much lower voltages, gases are not evolved at the inert anode, and being a one electron process, power consumption is less per pound of copper treated. A disadvantage is the need for covered very well stirred elelctrolyte.\nCopper powder electrorefining offers a convenient way of converting copper powder to purer cathodes without the necessity for melting the powder and electrorefining a cast anode. The use of an inert anode avoids the trouble associated with the use of soluble copper anodes.\nA convenient cell arrangement, allowing efficient circulation, removal of anolyte and replacement by fresh electrolyte, is shown in FIG. 3. In FIG. 3 a form of cuprous electrowinning is illustrated but the main feature is a design which is a preferred form of the electrolytic cell for electrochemical disproportionation. The electrodes are connected to a power supply, which is not shown. The numerals represent: 1- an inert anode, e.g. of carbon, 2 - a copper cathode, 3- inlet pipes for admitting at high speed an electrolyte of cuprous sulphate in acidified water containing an organic nitrile, with good agitation past the electrodes, 4 - outlet pipes for removing anolyte containing cupric sulphate, 5 - high speed circulating pumps, 6 - storage vessel for cuprous sulphate solutions, 7 - electrolysis vessel, preferably covered with the electrolyte under a non-oxidising atmosphere, containing the cuprous sulphate solution, 8 - storage for cupric sulphate solutions, 9 - reaction vessel for reduction of cupric sulphate solutions, 10 - system for removing insoluble impurities (slimes) 11 - system for adding reductant, 12 - a system for removing solids from the electrolyte, 13 - a system for bleeding off the electrolyte, 14 - a system for purifying the electrolyte and/or adjusting its composition, 15 - a system for removing impurities removed from the electrolyte in 14, 16 - a system for conveying the electrolyte containing cuprous sulphate.\nThermal disproportionation of Cu+.\nCopper can be recovered from aqueous solutions of cupric salts by reduction methods other than the electrowinning process. With solid reducing agents such as iron, nickel and zinc, the process is known as cementation. With reducing agents, such as sulphur dioxide, hydrogen and carbon monoxide, it is known as precipitation.\nCementation suffers from the disadvantage that the \"cupreous powder\" is very finely divided, well oxidised and badly contaminated by the solid reducing agent and other species which are reduced concurrently. The process is inefficient because the reducing agent becomes coated with copper and is not exposed to more cupric salt solution.\nPrecipitation is usually from ammoniacial solutions and high temperatures and pressures are needed. Hydrogen is the preferred reducing agent and sulphur dioxide gives incomplete reduction at high temperature and pressure.\nCement copper must be purified by the pyrometallurgical route and losses of copper are a problem.\nThermal disproportionation of Cu+ involves precipitation of copper from acidified solutions of cuprous salts in mixtures of volatile organic nitriles and water by thermal removal of the nitrile e.g. by distillation. The solution is free of solids prior to the winning and if necessary certain soluble impurities have been removed prior to the winning step. Thus a pure copper, whose quality as a powder can be controlled by additives, \"seeds\" and the conditions of precipitation, is produced. This powder is a more desirable product than cupreous powder produced by cementation.\nThe process is applied to solutions of cuprous salts, prepared for example as outlined in FIG. 6. Control of pH prevents precipitation of salts, e.g. of Fe2 + and of SO3 =, and precipitation of Cu2 O or CuOH. The concentration of acid influences the nature of the precipitated copper, high acidities (> 5% H2 SO4 by volume) tend to give less discrete particles. The organic nitrile is removed in whole or in part from the cuprous solution, usually by efficient distillation, preferably under a reduced pressure. This allows lower temperatures for boiling and thus minimises hydrolysis of the nitrile. The distillation is preferably carried out in the absence of significant amounts of oxygen and recovery of copper is enhanced by using a reducing or non-oxidising atmosphere (e.g. of N2). The degree and nature of stirring, during removal of the nitrile, the speed at which nitrile is removed, and the presence of additives and seeds all influence the nature of the precipitated copper. We prefer to remove the nitrile slowly from a well agitated \"tumbling\" solution containing glue and other additives such as sodium alkylarylsulphonates or ammonium lignin sulphonates. The nitrile usually comes off as an azeotrope with water.\nOnce the proportion of nitrile to cuprous ion in solution is below 2-3 moles to one of cuprous ion, the cuprous ion disproportionates to give copper and a cupric salt.\n\n 2 Cu.sup.+ \u2192 Cu + Cu.sup.2.sup.+\nRemoval of the nitrile is continued until the desired amount of copper powder is obtained. This copper is removed by a conventional solid-liquid separation (e.g. centrifuged), is washed and dried. This portion of the process uses conventional technology for handling copper powders, separating them from liquids and for avoiding their oxidation (cf. Butts). A preferred modification is in provision to recover the valuable nitriles by distillation from the \"wet copper\" and the washings. A preferred method of washing is to use the acidified distillate of the nitrilewater and return this to the circuit. The copper is removed from the circuit and is washed with hot acidified water, then with hot water in a non-oxidising atmosphere.\nThe process of thermal disproportionation may be modified if the solution of cuprous salts in a volatile nitrile and acidified water contains ions e.g. Ag+, which are more easily reduced to solids in the medium than is cuprous ion to copper. As the nitrile is removed, the first reaction is, as illustrated by silver.\n\n Cu.sup.+ + Ag.sup.+ \u2192 Cu.sup.2.sup.+ + Ag\nfollowed by\n\n Cu.sup.+ + Cu.sup.+ \u2192 Cu.sup.2.sup.+ + Cu.\nThus it is desirable to carry out the thermal disproportionation in at least two steps, because the first solids which are precipitated will contain high proportions of the more easily reduced material.\nAn alternative procedure for removing reducible species, especially in the case of solutions containing significant amounts of silver salts, is to cement the reducible species with an excess of copper to produce a colourless solutuion, prior to thermal disproportionation. Reaction 13 of FIG. 6 takes place readily with finely divided copper and solutions of silver salts in acidifed nitrile-water mixtures in the absence of Cu2 +.\nThis method of thermal disproportionation usually enables one to recover a maximum of 50% of the copper from a cuprous salt solution, the other 50% is cupric salt. A highly desirable addition to the basic invention is to recycle the nitrile-depleted cupric salt solution with the distilled azeotrope containing the nitrile and the washings, then to regenerate cuprous salts from cupric by any of the methods outlined in FIG. 6 or by any other acceptable method. This is known as cuprous winning, copper powder refining or cuprous leaching, depending on the method of regeneration.\nCuprous Winning\nThis is illustrated in a preferred form in FIG. 4.\nIn FIG. 4 the numerals represent: 1 - a distillation vessel for disproportionation of cuprous salt solutions, 2 - a reaction vessel for reduction of cupric salt solutions, 3 - a system for removing, washing and drying copper powder, 4 - removal of volatile nitrile and its azeotrope and condensation, 5- vessel for storing distilled nitrile and its azeotrope, 6 - system for splitting the distillate into roughly equal proportions, 7 - a system for effecting separation of solids and liquids, 8 - a system for adding reducing agent to the reaction vessel, 9 - a system for adding nitrile and its azeotrope to the reaction vessel, 10 - a solution containing some cupric salt solution in a solution depleted of nitrile by distillation, 11 - a solution of cuprous salt in acidified water containing a volatile organic nitrile, with or without additives and copper seeds, 12 - copper depleted solution containing oxidised reductant.\nFor example, the cupric salt in the nitrile-depleted solvent (10), prepared by thermal disproportionation of a cuprous salt solution (11), is recombined (9), with the nitrile-water azeotrope distillate and washings and is reduced by the addition of a suitable reducing agent (8), such as iron or SO2 in proportions which satisfy the stoichiometry of equations 8 or 9 of FIG. 6.\n\n Cu.sup.2.sup.+ + Red \u2192 Cu.sup.+ + Ox.sup.+\n(where Red is the reductant and Ox+is its oxidised form)\nThe reduced solution of cuprous salt is filtered if necessary and the cycles of nitrile removal, copper precipitation and cupric salt reduction are repeated until the desired recovery of copper is achieved.\nIdeally, the overall material balance is represented by\n\n Cu.sup.2.sup.+ + 2Red \u2192 Cu + 20\u00d7.sup.+\nbut this would require an infinite number of cycles, so a choice must be made, and the remaining small amount of copper in solution is recovered on other ways, e.g. cupric cementation by iron.\nIt will be appreciated that the \"feed\" for a thermal disproportionation followed by a cuprous winning process may be a solution of cupric sulphate, to which sufficient suitable nitrile has been added, followed by reduction with the same suitable reducing agent, e.g. iron or SO2, chosen for the later steps of the cuprous winning process.\nPrecautions against loss of the valuable, volatile, toxic and inflammable nitrile are normally taken, e.g. reactions in sealed vessels or under condensers. The process is best suited to an enclosed system with oxygen excluded as much as possible.\nRecovery or use of the oxidised form of the reductant, of traces of undistilled nitrile, and of traces of copper in the spent solution is an economically desirable part of the process. Where SO2 is the reductant, the acid produced may be used for leaching of oxodised copper to give cupric sulphate solutions, which may be reduced to cuprous sulphate or sulphite solutions as outlined and thus a continuous cuprous winning is achieved.\nCopper Powder Refining\nThis principle is illustrated in a preferred form of a continuous process in FIG. 5.\nIn FIG. 5 the numerals refer to: 1 - a reaction vessel for converting copper and cupric salts to cuprous salts, 2 - removal of insoluble impurities (slimes), 3 - system for adding particulate materials containing copper to the reaction vessel, 4 - system for removing solids from the cuprous salt solution, 5 - Distillation vessel for disproportionation of cuprous salt solutions, 6 - removal of distillate containing a volatile nitrile or its azeotrope, 7 - condensed nitrile or its azeotrope, 8 - system for dividing a liquid into two portions, 9 - removal of copper powder and its washing with condensate, 10 - system for further washing and drying of copper powder, 11 - system for separating solids and liquids, 12 - solution containing cupric salt in a nitrile depleted solution, 13 - solution of a cuprous salt in acidified water containing a volatile organic nitrile with or without additives, 14 - system for purifying solution 12 and adjusting its composition, 15 - system for removing soluble impurities.\nConventional methods of purifying copper powders (cf. Butts) involve either pyrometallurgical treatment followed by cupric electrorefining of copper anodes, for low grade powders (<98% copper) or melting and casting to anodes, followed by cupric electrorefining. These methods involve significant losses of copper, are slow and require considerable handling of the copper. Cupreous powder and the TORCO concentrate, for example, require the complete smelting and refining operation to produce pure copper.\nOur method of copper powder refining avoids pyrometallurgy with its high capital cost, and also avoids the slow cupric electrorefining step. It is a cheaper and faster method of preparing purer copper from any finely divided form of copper-containing material, than is any existing method known to us. Capital costs are relatively low compared to pyrometallurgy.\nThe method is based on thermal disproportionation, except that in the preferred procedure one starts with a solution of a suitable cupric salt in a mixture of sufficient of a suitable volatile organic nitrile and acidified water and reduces this with impure copper as reducing agent (cf. reaction 1 of FIG. 6). The resulting cuprous solution is then transferred to a distillation vessel (5) and distilled to remove nitrile (6), precipitate the copper (9) and regenerate cupric salt. The cupric salt solution (12) and distillate (7) are combined and are transferred to a reaction vessel (1) in which reduction with copper (3) is repeated. Thus ideally, the copper concentration of the electrolyte is unchanged, and crude particulate copper (3) is converted to purer particulate copper (10). The thermal disproportionation step in which nitrile is distilled to precipitate copper from the cuprous solution is as already described and the method of performing reaction 1 described in detail later. The method is preferably continuous, with several cycles of copper leaching and copper precipitation taking place in reaction and precipitation vessels respectively. The two vessels are separated by conventional systems for removing solids from the electrolyte.\nSuitable materials containing finely divided copper metal are efficiently agitated by conventional solid-liquid leaching procedures (cf. Butts) in vessels sealed from the atmosphere, with a solution of a suitable cupric salt (preferably cupric sulphate) in a solvent which is kept acidic with a suitable acid throughout the process and which contains water and sufficient of a suitable organic nitrile, preferably acetonitrile. The preferred temperature of leaching is 40\u00b0-65\u00b0 C, but this is not crucial, although leaching is faster at elevated temperatures. The copper and some other oxidisable and basic materials (e.g. iron, tin, copper oxide, arsenic, nickel and to some extent bismuth) dissolve, to give cuprous solutions, plus soluble impurities. Other impurities, e.g. gold, silica, alumina, carbonaceous material, lead, and to a large extent antimony and silver, do not dissolve, they form slimes. These are filtered off at appropriate intervals. The cuprous solutions are separated from any solid material e.g. by filtration, settling, or centrifuging, and the organic nitrile is separated from the cuprous solution. Removal of volatile nitrile is continued until the desired amount of copper is obtained and separated, as outlined. The cupric salt is recycled to the leaching tank, after combining with the nitrile-water distillate, to dissolve more copper from the copper containing material and to generate more cuprous solution by reaction 1. The process is preferably continuous. Portions of the nitrile-deficient electrolyte are treated by conventional methods (cf. Butts loc. cit.) from time to time to keep soluble impurities, e.g. OX+ at an acceptable level, consistent with the desired purity of the precipitated copper.\nCopper powder refining can of course be a batch process, using a reservoir of Cu+ salt, as shown in FIG. 6, with removal of cupric solution and eventual reduction with copper, using the distillate or some other source of nitrile. Suitable heat exchangers are desirable, since in principle there is very little consumption of energy.\nOxygen should be excluded as much as possible from the process, because both cuprous solutions and the wet copper powder are oxidised to some extent by oxygen. A reducing or non-oxidising atmosphere is desirable (e.g. N2). Precautions against loss of the volatile, toxic and inflammable nitriles should be taken and the process is best suited to an enclosed system. The solutions are not particularly corrosive, except in the leaching tank, which should be resistant to the oxidising power of Cu2 + in the presence of nitriles. Lead, glass and PVC are suitable materials, but stainless steel is not inert over long periods.\nCuprous Leaching\nThis is closely related to copper powder refining, except that in the preferred method cuprous salt is regenerated from the cupric salt solution plus the nitrile azeotrope produced by thermal disproportionation, by reacting Cu2 + with cuprous sulphide, or materials containing cuprous and sulphide ions or with cupric sulphide, or materials containing cupric and sulphide ions, in a leaching vessel under the conditions of reaction 3 or 5 or of the combined reaction of 3 and 5 of FIG. 6 respectively. The resulting cuprous salt solution is filtered, freed of sulphur, purified and is thermally disproportionated.\nThe net result is either\n\n Cu.sub.2 S \u20e1 Cu + CuS\nor\n\n Cu.sub.2 S \u20e1 2Cu + S\nor\n\n CuS \u20e1 Cu + S\nso that effectively copper sulphides are converted to copper and sulphur via cuprous ions. The reactions are equilibra so that continuous removal of cuprous salt and sulphur and replacement with fresh cupric sulphate solutions is a desirable feature.\nCuprous leaching has the advantage that, unlike smelting of copper sulphides, sulphur dioxide is not produced thus minimising pollution and the cuprous salt solution produced by the leach is readily converted to copper. In principle no chemicals are consumed. The method is simpler than ferric sulphate leaching followed by electrowinning in aqueous solution.\nAs noted later, reactions 3 and 5 and the combined reaction require quite high concentrations of acid and of volatile nitrile. Chalcopyrite is not leached effectively by this procedure but if it is preheated with sulphur to more than about 400\u00b0C a leachable formof copper sulphide is produced.\nMuch the same scheme as is illustrated in FIG. 5 is preferably used for continuous cuprous leaching with the reaction vessel suitably designed for operation of reactions 3 or 5 or the combined reactions.\nMethods of Preparing Solutions of Cuprous Salts\nThe processes of electrochemical and thermal disproportionation depend on having suitable solutions of cuprous salts, preferably of what we believe to be cuprous sulphate or CuHSO4 in the first process and Cu2 SO4, CuHSO4, CuNO3 or CuHSO3 in the second.\nCuprous salts, such as cuprous sulphate, are not stable in aqueous solutions at useful concentrations and cuprous copper only exists in completely aqueous solution at a useful concentration when complexed with suitable bases, as in CuCl2 -, Cu(NH3)2 + and Cu(CN)3 2 -. The chemistry of monovalent copper is outlined in Butts (loc.cit.). We believe that none of the processes described here which are based on \"cuprous chemistry\" in nitrile-water mixtures are possible in purely aqueous solvents.\nWe have found that in the presence of an organic nitrile, solutions of cuprous salts, e.g. those believed to be Cu2 SO4, CuClO4, CuNO3, CuHSO4, and CuHSO3, are stable, even in highly aqueous solutions. In general, more than 2.5 moles of the nitrile per mole of stabilized cuprous ions, are needed for stability. The role of the nitrile is believed to be that of an uncharged complexing agent which strongly solvates cuprous ion and stabilizes it with respect to its disproportionation into copper and cupric cation, even in acid solution. Suitable organic nitriles (e.g. acetonitrile) appear to solvate cuprous ion more powerfully than does water, even in highly aqueous solutions.\nWe have found that the following reactions are practicable in solvents containing a suitable organic nitrile and usually water, but sometimes in anhydrous nitriles, to give stable solutions of what we believe to be cuprous bisulphate or sulphate, or in some cases certain other cuprous salts. A requirement is that the anion accompanying the cuprous cation (e.g. sulphate, perchlorate, bisulphite, BF4) generally be \"inert\". That is, it should not interfere with the general chemistry of cuprous ion and copper as outlined in this application, and as required by the processes, (e.g. concentrated nitric acid dissolves copper and oxidises Cu+, and CuHSO3  is unstable in strongly acidic solutions, so nitrates and sulphites are generally unsuitable in processes e.g. electrochemical disproportionation, preferably requiring strongly acid conditions, but restricted forms of thermal disproportionation, preferably at relatively high pH, are possible in the presence of these anions). Relevant anions are described later in this application. Sulphates or bisulphates are preferred over all other salts for the reactions shown, partly for economic reasons, but in some cases the greater solubility of copper nitrate salts is an advantage.\nThe reactions which produce solutions of cuprous salts are believed to proceed as shown by the following equations but the complete stoichiometry has not been established in all cases. In many cases the solutions should be filtered, their proportions adjusted to a suitable composition and byproducts of the reactions partly removed before transfer to the central \"storage\" of cuprous salt solution, which is shown in FIG. 6 and which feeds the thermal or electrochemical disporportionation systems.\nIn FIG. 6 the numerals refer to the following: 1 - supplies of appropriate materials containing copper or copper salts including copper sulphides and ores, 2 - reaction vessesl in which reactions 1 - 13 take place, to produce solutions of cuprous salts in acid solutions of water and organic nitriles, 3 - systems for separating solids from these solutions, 4 - systems for adjusting electrolyte composition and purifying it as needed, 5 - removal of insolubles from the reactions 1 - 13, 6 - removal of soluble impurities form reactions 1 - 13, separated as in 4, 7 - vessel for storing cupric salt solutions, 8 - vessel for storing cuprous salt solutions, 9 - cell for electrochemical disproportionation of cuprous sulphate solutions, 10 - vessel for thermal disproportionation of cuprous salts in acidified aqueous solutions containing volatile organic nitriles including source of heat or method of reducing the pressure, 11 - removal of volatile nitrile as distillate and condensation, 12 - solution of a cupric salt in acidified water containing an organic nitrile, 13 - solution of a cuprous salt in an acidified aqueous solution containing an organic nitrile with or without additives, 14 - an inert anode attached to a power supply, 15 - a copper cathode starting sheet attached to the power supply, 16 - system for washing and drying copper, 17 - removed copper cathodes and 18 - copper powder.\nMethods of producing solutions of cuprous salts in nitrile water mixtures.\nThe following equations are believed to represent the stoichiometry and other products in reactions which do provide methods of preparing cuprous solutions, when the reactants shown are mixed in solutions of water and organic nitriles. Species shown above the reaction arrow are believed to be catalysts. The equilibria shown depend among other things on the proportion of organic nitrile present.\n\n 1.

However equivalent reactions do proceed in water in the presence of certain complexing anions (e.g. CN-, Cl-). However the resulting cuprous complexes are not suitable for thermal disproportionation. The reaction of dry cupric perchlorate with pure copper to give CuClO4 solutions in anhydrous acetonitrile is a known reaction, but such solutions are not satisfactory for thermal or electrochemical disproportionation. Until our discovery, there was no reason to believe that this reaction could be extended to reactions of other cupric salts, especially of cupric sulphate, with impure copper, in acidified solvents containing a variety of nitriles and very significant proportions of water. Indeed, before our discovery we had expected that water would be the active solvent and would disproportionate cuprous salts, when added for example to anhydrous solutions of cuprous perchlorate in acetonitrile, prepared as described in the literature. We were also unable to extrapolate to the behaviour of other salts in water-nitrile mixtures from the behaviour of perchlorates in anhydrous acetonitrile, partly because for example cupric sulphate will not satisfactorily generate solutions containing significant amounts of cuprous sulphate when reacted with copper in anhydrous acetonitrile.\nBefore this work, the behaviour of impurities commonly present in impure copper (e.g. iron, nickel, silver, gold, arsenic, alumina, bismuth, lead, anitmony) in the new composition was also uncertain and knowledge of such behaviour is essential before the reaction can be utilized as a method of preparing cuprous solutions suitable for preparation of purer copper by thermal or electrochemical disproportionation. The reaction provides a new method of leaching copper from materials containing copper and insoluble species such as lead, gold, silica, alumina, carbonaceous material and antimony. Previously copper was leached as cupric salts using oxidising acids.\nThe following description of the preferred method of preparing solutions of what we believe to be cuprous sulphate or CuHSO4 substantially free of cupric sulphate illustrates the method.\nMix equimolar or less than equimolar proportions of cupric sulphate, and finely divided copper (minus 16 plus 100 mesh) in a reaction vessel with a solvent containing about 12 moles of a suitable organic nitrile per mole of cupricions, plus sufficient water to dissolve the resulting cuprous sulphate or bisulphate. The solution is kept acidic with a proportion of sulphuric acid which is appropriate to the particular process, preferably between 0.5 and 10% by volume H2 SO4. It is well agitated, e.g. by magnetic stirring or tumbling, preferably at a temperature of between 40\u00b0 and 60\u00b0C in the absence of oxygen. Higher temperatures encourage loss of nitrile by hydrolysis, lower temperatures give slower dissolution of copper. The blue cupric sulphate solution changes to colourless as the copper dissolves. As expected, the rate of copper dissolution is enhanced by elevated temperatures, by increasingly finely divided copper and by the increased efficiency of mixing the solid and liquid phases. If necessary, the solution is filtered to remove insoluble material such as lead, gold, antimony, silver, silica, carbon, unreacted copper and alumina. If the solution develops a significan blue colour on standing in a stoppered vessel, then it is being oxidised, or lacks sufficient organic nitrile and more should be added together with a little copper to remove the blue colour. A careful monitoring to assure acidity is desirable for solutions originally low in acid (ca. pH2). It is desirable to exclude oxygen as much as possible, because it oxidises cuprous salts and generates base and cupricion. This, together with the fact that many of the nitriles are volatile, toxic and inflammable, makes it desirable to operate in sealed reaction vessels whenever possible. Reaction vessels should be resistant to the solutions. Lead, glass, and PVC are some of the suitable materials for reaction vessels.\nIf finely divided materials containing copper plus impurities are used to prepare the cuprous solutions by this method, we have found that readily oxidisable materials, such as iron, nickel, tin, arsenic, cadmium and zinc, which are commonly present in impure copper, also reduce the cupric sulphate under the reaction conditions and themselves dissolve, presumably as sulphates. Other materials, such as gold, lead, silica, carbonaceous material, and to a large extent antimony, bismuth and silver, which are commonly found in impure copper, were found not to dissolve in the electrolyte under the reaction conditions. To a certain extent, cuprous oxide and copper sulphides associated with the copper, dissolve in some compositions to give cuprous sulphate solutions as outlined for following reactions.\nA process of forming cuprous sulphate solutions from materials containing copper has been described. It is now obvious to those skilled in chemistry that we are dealing with the chemistry of Cu2 +, Cu+ and Cu, so that some other cupric salts of inert non-complexing anions, e.g. Cu(Cl04)2 (hazardous) and Cu(NO3)2 (at controlled pH), other than cupric sulphate, could be used, even if only in a restricted way, to generate certain cuprous salt solutions from copper in the nitrile-water mixtures. However we believe that sulphates are the most suitable salts for the process, particularly for economic reasons. The question of suitable salts is considered in more detail below, but nitrates in solutions which are less than 0.3, more preferably less than 0.2 molar in H+ are next preferred to sulphates for reaction 1.\nA modification of reaction 1 is reaction 2 in which less than stoichiometric amounts of cupric salt are used as reagent, but cupric salt is regenerated by the action of oxygen on the product cuprous salt in acidified solution. The regenerated cupric salt converts more copper to cuprous salt. The net result is a reaction which appears to be the reaction of copper with sulphuric acid in the presence of oxygen, with cupric salt as catalyst.\n\n 2Cu + 1/2O.sub.2 + 2H.sup.+ Cu.sup.2.sup.+ 2 Cu.sup.+ + H.sub.2 O\nThe rate of supply and the pressure of oxygen or air is preferably controlled so that excess oxygen does not oxidise more cuprous to cupric sulphate than is required by the stoichiometry of the reaction shown. Thus cuprous solutions are generated.\nThe method of dissolving copper is as before, but preferably at lower temperature, (20\u00b0-30\u00b0C) with provision for good mixing of air with the composition and solids, and for admission of air and acid, as oxygen and acid are consumed. The composition contains less, preferably 1-20% of the concentration of cupric sulphate required by the stoichiometry of reaction 1.\nThe oxidising method has the disadvantage that acid is consumed and it is slow except when the oxygen or air is under pressure, but it is a very useful way of initiating both reaction 1 and subsequent copper powder refining or copper powder electrorefining processes, especially if supplies of cupric sulphate are not available for starting the process. If operated to a limited extent it helps to control copper concentrations in copper powder refining and copper powder electrorefining.\nMethods of producing solutions of cuprous from cupric salts using reducing agents (reactions 5-9 and 12).\nCupric salts are conventionally reduced (cf. Butts) to copper in aqueous solution by processes known as cementation (e.g. with iron) or precipitation (e.g. with hydrogen). Reduction with SO2 in water is inefficient and requires extreme conditions of temperature and pressure. Cement copper is usually a very crude material, heavily contaminated with iron and well oxidised. Cementation with nickel or cadmium for example is used to purify solutions of their metal salts which are contaminated with cupric salts.\nOur new methods of reducing cupric to cuprous solutions in acidic mixtures of water with organic nitriles have no direct precedent, to our knowledge. They have the advantage that they produce solutions which are suitable for thermal or electrochemical disproportionation. In some cases they also provide new leaching methods.\nReactions 7 and 8\n\n 3SO.sub.2 + 4H.sub.2 O + 2Cu.sup.2.sup.+ \u2192 2 Cu.sup.+ + H.sub.2 SO.sub.4 + 2H.sub.2 SO.sub.3 + 2H.sup.+                   ...(7)\n\n 2 Cu.sup.2.sup.+  + M \u2192 2Cu.sup.+ + M.sup.2.sup.+   ....(8)\nStable solutions of cuprous salts may be prepared by the following method in which cupric salts are reduced with the appropriate proportion of iron, zinc, nickel, tin or cadmium, or with sulphur dioxide or sodium metabisulphite, in aqueous solutions containing an organic nitrile. Iron and SO2 at normal temperature and pressure are the preferred reductants, but in the case of SO2, the solution should be maintained at a sufficiently low acidity for efficient reduction and formation of soluble CuHSO3 rather than insoluble Cu2 SO3. This can be achieved by having buffers such as basic copper salts, calcium carbonate or ammonium acetate present or by using sodium metabisulphite or by reducing cupric ammonium complex salts with excess SO2.\nOne advantage of the methods is that solutions for thermal disproportionation are produced. With solid reductants, such as iron and nickel, the reduction is faster than cementation of cupric solutions in water, because a protective layer of copper is not formed on the solid reductant. Reduction with nickel is particularly effective.\nThe reactions are illustrated by the best method known to us for preparing cuprous from cupric sulphate solutions by reduction, on a laboratory scale.\nTo an aqueous solution of cupric sulphate containing a little sulphuric acid is added sufficient of a suitable organic nitrile. If cupric sulphate precipitates on addition of the nitrile it will redissolve as reduction proceeds and cuprous sulphate solution is formed. The solution is stirred or shaken with a suitable reducing agent in the proportion of one equivalent of reducing agent per mole of cupric sulphate for those reducing agents (e.g. iron, zinc, nickel or cadmium) which would produce cement copper if present in higher proportions. For less powerful reducing agents, e.g. SO2, at atmospheric pressure and temperature, which will reduce cupric sulphate to cuprous salts but not cuprous salts to copper, an excess of reducing agent may be used. It is desirable to remove the acid, e.g. by having sufficient of a weak base (e.g. CaCO3 or ammonium acetate) present to complete the reduction, when SO2 is the reductant. Alternatively, reduction of cupric sulphate to cuprous salts by SO2 proceeds tolerably at moderate pressures (e.g. 5 atmospheres) and temperatures (of 50\u00b0-100\u00b0 C) in the absence of bases, at an initial pH of between 2-6, in the nitrilewater mixtures.\nThe reduction is complete when the blue colour of cupric sulphate has disappeared, consistent with any colour of the reducing agent or its oxidation product. E.g. cuprous bisulphite is yellow in the composition and NiSO4 is green.\nRates of reduction increase with increasing temperature, but an upper limit is imposed by hydrolysis of the nitrile (significant at 75\u00b0C) and the volatility of the nitrile (e.g. acetonitrile-water azeotrope at 78\u00b0C).\nIf the reducing agent (e.g. iron, zinc, cadmium or nickel) is a solid, the reduction is faster the more finely divided the solid and the more efficient the stirring or shaking. Solids of minus 16 mesh are preferred in well stirred solutions. However even with bulky iron (e.g. iron nails) the reduction is much faster than is aqueous cementation with the same reductant. If the reducing agent (e.g. SO2) is a gas, reaction is faster and more efficient under increased pressure and lower pH values are possible, but the advantage of simply bubbling the reductant through a buffered solution at atmospheric pressure, makes this the preferred method, on a laboratory scale, when the reductant is SO2.\nPrecautions against volatile, toxic and inflammable nitriles are desirable, so that equipment should be sealed wherever possible, or should include condensers. The oxidation products of the reductants, e.g. FeSO4, H2 SO4, NiSO4, build up in the solution and may have to be removed from the cuprous solution, depending on the subsequent application of the solution. Removal can be done by known and conventional methods, e.g. of precipitation, neutralization, ion-exchange, etc., to the extent demanded by the subsequent process and the purity of copper required.\nThe processes are illustrated in detail by the examples given later.\nThe reduction reactions 8 can be utilized in the following new methods for producing copper from cupric sulphate and for leaching nickel, cadmium or cobalt values from materials containing one or more of these metals.\nThe conventional process most closely related to the new methods is cementation of aqueous cupric sulphate solutions with nickel, cadmium or cobalt to give copper and solutions of NiSO4, CdSO4 or CoSO4. This cementation is difficult with many forms of nickel and requires specially precipitated or sponge nickel. It also suffers from the disadvantage that the cementing agent becomes coated with copper powder, so that cementation is slowed and reduced in efficiency. The new methods provide a much faster method of dissolving up the metals and of reducing the cupric solution.\nThe method is based on a combination of the reduction reactions 8 and the processes of thermal disproportionation of cuprous sulphate solutions. The preferred form of the process is summarized in the following reaction sequence and if more than 20% by volume of organic nitrile is present, is particularly suitable for the treatment of high grade mattes containing nickel and copper which are of low sulphur content. In such cases those parts of the matte which are metal sulphides are oxidised to sulphur and the cupric sulphate is reduced to cuprous sulphate.\nAn excess of cupric sulphate dissolved in weakly acidified water-sulphuric acid, plus sufficient of a suitable volatile organic nitrile, preferably acetonitrile, to stabilize the eventual proportion of Cu2 SO4 is agitated with preferably finely divided (-16+240 mesh) material containing nickel and/or cobalt and/or cadmium (M). Sufficient cupric sulphate is present to maintain some cupric ion in solution at completion of reaction. The leaching and subsequent steps, as far as possible, are preferably carried out in sealed vessels at elevated temperatures (ca. 40\u00b0-65\u00b0C) in the absence of oxygen. The cuprous salt solution is separated from solids and is thermally disproportionated, as herein described, to give copper, and solutions of cupric sulphate and the other metal sulphates. The solutions are reconstituted, preferably with distilled nitrile, and more cupric sulphate is added. This solution is recycled with fresh material containing nickel, and/or cobalt, and/or cadmium until a stage is reached after n cycles, where the nitrile-depleted solution from the thermal disproportionation contains nMSO4 + CuSO4.\nA preferable procedure then is to add sufficient powdered active metal M (e.g. sponge nickel) to the nitrile depleted solution of nMSO4 + CuSO4 to cement the copper, as in conventional aqueous cementation of cupric sulphate by cadmium, nickel or cobalt. The resulting solution of (n+1)MSO4 in an almost squeous medium is suitable for processing to recover M. Alternatively, cupric sulphide can be precipitated by treating the solution with H2 S for M = Ni or Co, or Cd in strong acid solutions to remove copper.\nAs in reaction 2, which is a modification of reaction 1an alternative but slower preferred procedure is to carry out the leaching step in the presence of less than the stoichiometric 2 moles of cupric sulphate, per mole of metal M, but to admit sufficient oxygen and sulphuric acid to the composition to regenerate cupric from cuprous sulphate, so that the cupric sulphate is effectively a catalyst and the reaction becomes ##EQU1## A concentration of between 0.5 and 4% cupric ion is preferred, but if copper metal is with M, then less cupric sulphate can be used. At appropriate stages of the leach, the solution contains M2 +  and Cu2 +  sulphates, the oxygen supply is cut off and more M is added to reduce the Cu2 +  to cuprous sulphate. This is thermally disproportionated to give copper and cupric sulphate. The copper is filtered off. The solutions are reconstituted and the leach continues, with the cupric concentration halved. Thus control of the copper content during leaching can be achieved.\n\n __________________________________________________________________________Leaching reaction          X.sub.i + M + 2CuSO.sub.4 \u2192 MSO.sub.4 + Cu.sub.2          SO.sub.4Solid liquid separation          \u2193          \u2193          X.sub.i MSO.sub.4 + Cu.sub.2 SO.sub.4          \u2193Thermal disproportionation          \u2193          CuCuSO.sub.4 + MSO.sub.4Add CuSO.sub.4, reconstitute          \u2193electrolyte if necessary          2CuSO.sub.4 + MSO.sub.4          \u2193Recycle with more X.sub.i + M          \u2193          X.sub.i 2MSO.sub.4 + Cu.sub.2 SO.sub.4After n cycles nMSO.sub.4 + CuSO.sub.4 from thermal          disproportionationCement with powdered          nMSO.sub.4 + CuSO.sub.4 + M\u2192 (n+1)MSO.sub.4 + Cu\"active\" M(or treat with H.sub.2 S          \u2193to form CuS in place of Cu)          \u2193solid-liquid separation          (n+1)MSO.sub.4 Cu          \u2193M = Ni, Co, Cd to hydrometallurgicalX.sub.i = insoluble impurities          treatment__________________________________________________________________________\n(The reaction sequence for obtaining copper from cupric sulphate and for leaching nickel, cobalt, sulphates (cadmium) from the metals in a non-oxidising atmosphere illustrates a preferred method, using compositions and reactions already described).\nA modification of the reduction of cupric salts to cuprous salts by SO2 provides a new method for extracting cuprous salts from basic oxidised copper, e.g. CuO, Tenorite, Malachite, Azurite, and Chrysocolla, using reaction 12, with sulphur dioxide in water containing sufficient of a suitable organic nitrile. Conventionally (cf. Butts) oxidised ores are leached with sulphuric acid and copper is cemented with iron or is electrowon from the cupric solution. Such methods are costly and inefficient. In the new process, cheap SO2 acts as a reducing agent for Cu2 + and produces acid, which is consumed by leaching the basic copper, so that the process continues. The reactions take place at atmospheric pressure and at normal tempereatures and are believed to be represented by the following equations, which use CuO as an example of basic oxidised copper,\n\n 3CuO + 3SO.sub.2 + H.sub.2 O \u2192 2CuHSO.sub.3 + CuSO.sub.4 (12).\nThe method consists of mixing the basic oxidised copper in an atmosphere of sulphur dioxide with a composition composed of sufficient of a suitable organic nitrile and water, preferably in a leaching vessel, which is sealed, and leaching by conventional leaching methods for extracting copper values from materials containing copper with solid, liquid and gaseous reactants.\nThe solution of CuHSO3 and CuSO4 is separated from solids, then copper is recovered for example by thermal disproportionation. Under some conditions, cuprous sulphite is precipitated with the copper, but if washed with dilute aqueous sulphuric acid, this disproportionates to copper and cupric salt solutions so that copper can be separated. Sulphur dioxide reduction is also possible to give a homogenous solution if the copper ammonium salt solutions from an ammoniacal leach, e.g. of copper sulphides, are mixed with an organic nitrile and the solution is saturated with sulphur dioxide until the blue colour disappears.\nAnother method of producing cuprous solutions and of leaching copper values from cupric sulphide or materials containing cupric sulphide uses reaction 5, or 6, in which cupric sulphate is thought to be reduced by sulphide ion, or hydrogen sulphide, which is in equilibrium with cupric sulphide in acid solutions containing water and sufficient of a suitable organic nitrile. The reaction is similar to the reduction of ferric salts in aqueous solution by cukpric sulphide, with production of sulphur, except that here, cupric salts are reduced. The reactions proceed at useful rates at elevated temperatures and are believed to be represented by the following equilibria, although cuprous ions may react with sulphur to give cuprous sulphide, not cupric sulphide in the reverse reactions ##EQU2## Both cuprous salt solutions and sulphur were isolated, but other oxidation products of sulphur and cupric ions may also be formed, especially if oxygen is used under pressure in reaction 6.\nA preferred method for preparing cuprous solutions by reaction 5 uses conventional solid-liquid leaching procedures in sealed systems at elevated temperatures, with finely divided (-100 mesh) cupric sulphide, and an excess of CuSO4 in 5 to 10% by volume of H2 SO4, water and between 35 and 60% by volume of a suitable nitrile at 50\u00b0 - 70\u00b0C in a non-oxidising atmosphere. Too much CuSO4 leads to separation of nitrile and water, so it is sometimes useful to add CuSO4 as reaction proceeds. Reaction is continued until the copper concentration reaches a steady value. The cuprous sulphate solution is separated from sulphur and other solids, including unleached material, and is stored in a sealed vessel and the leach is continued with fresh cupric sulphate solution. Preferred nitriles are acetonitrile and 2-hydroxycyanoethane.\nA modification of this method is reaction 6, where the preferred procedure is much the same, except that less than the stoichiometric amount of cupric sulphate is used, and oxygen is admitted to regenerate cupric ions from cuprous ions. Provision is made to add more acid and oxygen as reaction proceeds, but the supply of oxygen is preferably controlled so that the stoichiometry of equation 6 is preserved and a final solution of cuprous sulphate, rather than cupric sulphate, is formed. As in reaction 2, the cupric sulphate is a catalyst and preferably between 1 and 20% of that required by the stoichiometry of equation 5 is used. Good mixing of the solid, liquid and gas phase is highly desirable. It is believed that reaction 6 may not be the only representation of reactions giving copper in solution by this method. Some oxidation of sulphide by oxygen to other sulphur species and of Cu+ to Cu2 + may take place, especially with oxygen under pressure.\nThe oxidising method has the disadvantage that acid is consumed, but is useful when adequate supplies of cupric sulphate are not available and equilibrium can be forced further to the right as cuprous ions are oxidised. Further notes on reactions 5 and 6 are included with the discussion of reaction 3 and 4.\nReduction with silver provides a method both for leaching silver from materials containing silver and for reducing cupric to cuprous salt solutions. The silver can readily be recovered as illustrated later. The method uses reaction 9. The equilibrium requires a relatively high proportion of organic nitrile in the water if it is to proceed to a useful extent to the right. A mixture of 0.05M cuprous and silver sulphates in solutions low in acetonitrile (ca. 20% by volume) is rapidly converted to cupric sulphate and silver by the reverse reaction.\nIn the preferred method, finely divided silver (-16 mesh) or finely divided materials containing silver, such as dore metal, lead-silver mixtures and cement silver, are shaken with an excess of cupric sulphate or cupric nitrate in a solution preferably 35 to 60% by volume acetonitrile, and acidified water. In the case of cupric nitrate, the acidity should be kept low (<0.2M in H+) to prevent nitric acid oxidising cuprous ion. Shaking is continued until the silver content of the solution reaches a constant value or is done in more than one extraction with fresh cupric salt, if optimum extraction is desired. The resulting solution is filtered to remove solids to give a mixture of silver, cuprous and cupric salts. As with most solid-liquid reactions, reaction 9 is faster at elevated temperatures, with more finely divided material containing silver and with more effective agitation. Reduction of the cupric solution is effective at room temperature in well stirred solutions, with most silver-containing materials, between minus 16 plus 240 mesh.\nOxidation by silver cations (reaction 13)\nParticulate copper is stirred with an equimolar proportion of a suitable silver salt, preferably silver sulphate, in sufficient of a suitable organic nitrile, and acidified water. Silver is cemented and a colourless cuprous salt solution is produced.\nAcid-base reactions (reaction 10) - Cu2 O + 2H+ \u2192 2Cu+ + H2 O.\nCuprous oxide dissolves in aqueous sulphuric acid to give cupric sulphate, but an equal amount of copper is also formed, presumably because any cuprous sulphate formed, immediately disproportionates in water. We believe that stable cuprous sulphate solutions have not been prepared by this method in purely aqueous solvents.\nCuprous sulphate or bisulphate solutions, suitable for cuprous winning, cuprous electrowinning, powder electrorefining, and cuprous electrorefining may be prepared by a new method, a preferred form of which follows. The reaction provides an excellent method of \"pickling\" i.e. of removing cuprous oxide films from case copper for hot rolled or copper rod, to give a material which is free of copper powder and thus more suitable for wire drawing, unlike copper pickled in aqueous sulphuric acid. The solvent is prepared by mixing water with at least sufficient of a suitable organic nitrile to stabilize the eventual concentration of cuprous salt. Sufficient sulphuric acid to satisfy the stoichiometry of the above equation and to provide at least a slight excess of acid, is added carefully with stirring, and the cuprous oxide, is stirred or shaken with the acidic solvent, preferably in a non-oxidising atmosphere in a reaction vessel. On a large scale, the conventional leaching methods for reaction of sulphuric acid with oxidised copper (cf. Butts loc. cit.) could be used, except that steps should be taken to contain volatile, toxic and inflammable nitriles and to minimise oxidation, so that sealed leaching vessels are preferred. The solution is separated from any solids and concentrated or diluted if necessary, to provide desired compositions. It is stored in sealed vessels, in a non-oxidising atmosphere.\nIn \"cuprous pickling\" the oxidised copper is washed in the acidified water containing the organic nitrile and is then preferably washed in a conventional aqueous pickling bath.\nThe resulting solution should be colourless or very pale blue, but if it is significantly blue it is preferably decolourised by addition of a little copper powder. If the blue colour persists or returns, more organic nitrile can be added. The rate of dissolution of the cuprous oxide is enhanced by efficient stirring and by having finely divided solids. It is greater at higher temperatures, but an economic upper limit is imposed by hydrolysis of the nitrile in the highly acidic solution. A preferred temperature range is 30\u00b0-50\u00b0C.\nThe reaction has been extended to ores such as cuprite and materials containing basic cuprous salts other than cuprous oxide, e.g. CuOH, Cu2 CO3 and basic cuprous sulphate.\nDissolution of cuprous sulphide (reaction 11) -Cu2 S + 2H+\u2192 2Cu+30  H2 S.\nCuprous sulphide is insoluble in aqueous sulphuric acid but is soluble in freshly acidified dry acetonitrile. This reaction has more limited application than the dissolution of cuprous oxide, because it is carried out in anhydrous acetonitrile rather than in water-nitrile mixtures and the acetonitrile is sometimes polymerised by the anhydrous acid. It is best suited to small scale reactions.\nDifferential precipitation - exchange of cupric and cuprous sulphides (reactions 3 and 4)\nThe reaction initially is thought to be as in reaction 3 and provides a new method of leaching copper values from materials containing cuprous and sulphide ions and of preparing cuprous solutions.\nSolutions of cuprous sulphate, suitable for thermal or electrochemical disproportionation, may be prepared by this reaction. The reaction occurs also to varying extents with copper mattes, chalcocite, bornite and related materials containing cuprous ions and sulphide ions. It is very slow and inefficient with chalcopyrite and pretreatment of chalcopyrite, e.g. with sulphur, is necessary for a satisfactory leach.\nCuprous sulphide has a much lower solubility product than cupric sulphide in acidified water, so that the equilibrium shown lies to the left in water. Thus cupric sulphate will not generate solutions containing significant amounts of cuprous sulphate when added to cuprous sulphide suspended in acidified water.\nWe have found that in water containing sufficient (preferably 30 -60% by volume) of suitable organic nitriles in moderately strong sulphuric acid, equilibrium is rapidly established even at room temperature, such that significant amounts of cuprous sulphate or bisulphate are produced. Indeed more copper ions are generated in solution than is expected from the stoichiometry of the above equation when cuprous sulphide is heated at 50\u00b0with excess cupric sulphate containing 10% by volume sulphuric acid in 50% by volume acetonitrile and water. It is thought that the aforementioned redox reaction (5) to produce sulphur, also takes place in the acidified aqueous nitrile solution during the reaction and that this increases the concentration of cuprous ions above that expected from the stoichiometry of the primary reaction. Thus cuprous sulphide and related materials can be oxidised to sulphur and solutions of cuprous sulphate by the combined equilibria 3 and 5.\nReaction rates are enhanced by having finely divided material (e.g. - 100 mesh) containing cuprous sulphide, by having high concentrations of sulphuric acid, by having well stirred solutions and elevated temperatures and by having increased proportions of nitrile. Hydrolysis of the nitrile imposes economic limitations on the strength of acid and the temperature chosen. A preferred method of carrying out reaction 3, followed in part by reaction 5, is as follows\nFinely divided cuprous sulphide (about -100 mesh) or materials containing cuprous ions and sulphide ions, such as copper matte, bornite, chalcocite, djurleite and digenite are well stirred or shaken, preferably at 50\u00b0-70\u00b0C in a sealed vessel in the absence of oxygen with an excess of cupric sulphate in a solvent consisting preferably of 30 -60% by volume but not less than 20% by volume of a suitable nitrile (preferably acetonitrile or 2-hydroxy cyanoethane), water, and sufficient sulphuric acid to give an acceptable rate of formation of cuprous solution, but not so much that hydrolysis of the nitrile at the necessarily elevated temperatures is economically unacceptable. We prefer between 5 and 10% sulphuric acid by volume. The process is continued until the copper in solution approaches a steady value (i.e. complete leaching or equilibrium). The total volume of solvent should be sufficient to dissolve the final concentration of cuprous sulphate or bisulphate. We find, for example, that a solution containing 100 gms of Cu+/litre, presumably as sulphate or bisulphate, in acidified 50% acetonitrile-water at 50\u00b0C is homogeneous. It is not essential that all the cupric sulphate be dissolved during the initial stages of the exchange reaction but if too much is present, the solution separates into two layers, so addition of CuSO4 as reaction proceeds is preferred. After completion of reaction, the solution is filtered free of cupric sulphide, sulphur and other solids and is stored in a sealed vessel in a non-oxidising atmosphere. Higher yields are obtained if the solids are repeatedly leached with fresh cupric sulphate solution, because reaction 3 is an equilibrium.\nAn alternative procedure is to carry out reaction 3 as specified, but in the presence of oxygen or air at 1 atmosphere or above, and preferably less than the stoichiometric amount of cupric sulphate, with provision for the addition of more acid as required. The oxygen slowly oxidises the product cuprous sulphate to cupric sulphate so that the cupric sulphate is effectively a catalyst and reaction 3 becomes 4. The amount of oxygen or air preferably is controlled at various stages of the leach so that cuprous, rather than cupric sulphate is formed, in accord with the stoichiometry of reaction 4.\nThe preferable amount of cupric sulphate used is such that it is more than 0.5% by weight Cu2 + for most of the leaching process, because lower concentrations lead to slower reactions. Reaction is preferably continued until the concentration of copper in solution approaches a steady value. The solution is filtered free of cupric sulphide and other solids and is stored in a sealed vessel in a non-oxidising atmosphere.\nIt is desirable to have good mixing between the solid, liquid and gas phases and the cuprous sulphide materials chould be finely divided, preferably -100 mesh.\nAs noted, reaction 5 and 6 are often consecutive with reactions 3 and 4, to consume CuS and generate more copper in solution, and further notes on the combined equilibria, which is effectively the redox reaction, Cu2 S + 2Cu2 + \u20e1  4Cu++ S, follow.\nFurther notes on Equilibria 3 and 5 and the combined reactions\nThe following reactions represent equilibria which are strongly influenced by the proportion of organic nitrile present in partly aqueous acidified solutions.\n\n Cu.sub.2 S + Cu.sup.2.sup.+ \u20e1 CuS + 2Cu.sup.+  (3)\n\n CuS + Cu.sup.2.sup.+ \u20e1  2Cu.sup.++ S           (5)\nOverall: Cu2 S + 2Cu2 + \u20e1  4Cu++ S (3) + (5)\nIn purely aqueous solution the equilibria lie so far to the left that the reactions are of no value for leaching copper values from materials containing copper and sulphur ions, but in the presence of sufficient of a suitable organic nitrile in acidified solution, the reactions proceed at a convenient rate and lie sufficiently to the right so that copper values can be extracted from many materials containing copper and sulphur ions, such as bornite, chalcocite, copper matte, cupric sulphide and digenite.\nThe relation between the equilibrium constants for the overall reaction and the proportion of nitrile is such that a proportion of between 30 and 60% by volume of acetonitrile is a preferred part of the composition from the thermodynamic viewpoint. Acid appears to lead to a faster reaction, as do elevated temperatures. In low proportions of acetonitrile, equilibrium is established less rapidly, so kinetic aspects are important. More copper is extracted if cuprous ion is removed as it is formed, e.g. by thermal or electrochemical disproportionation of the cuprous solution, or by its oxidation to cupric ion. Alternatively, sulphur is removed, e.g. by adsorption, chemical reaction or solvent extraction. A preferred method of operation is cuprous leaching, i.e. to continuously remove the pregnant leach liquor, separate precipitated sulphur by filtration, then remove the dissolved sulphur by a chemical reaction, e.g. with a little copper powder, then disproportionate the cuprous ion in the leach liquor, returning the cupric salt in acidified nitrile-water to the reaction vessel for further leaching.\nAn alternative for the combined reaction is to oxidise the cuprous ion with air as it forms, when the reaction becomes effectively a leach of copper sulphides by sulphuric acid and oxygen, catalysed by cupric ions as shown in the equations ##EQU3## In these circumstances the reaction proceeds to completion.\nIn practice, reactions 4 and 6 are slower than reactions 3 or 5 respectively, so that some cupric sulphide is formed and the first 50% of copper available from cuprous sulphide is leached more rapidly than the final 50%.\nThe combined reactions are not suitable for efficient leaching of chalcopyrite, but if the chalcopyrite is pretreated, for example by heating it with sulphur in a sealed vessel for several hours at 400\u00b0-500\u00b0C, then a leachable form of copper sulphide and a virtually non leachable iron sulphide is formed.\nProcessing of silver via cuprous salts.\nPreferred methods for separating silver and copper from materials containing silver and copper and for extracting and purifying silver materials containing silver, but no copper, are summarized in FIG. 7. The methods follow directly from the inventive concepts of reactions 1, 9 and 13 and of thermal disproportionation of cuprous salts, in nitrile-water mixture, as covered by this application. The methods are well suited to treatment of Dore metal, silver-lead-copper mixtures, and cement silver e.g. as obtained from the refining and smelting of non-ferrous base metals.\nSilver at present is extracted and purified in a number of ways, including cyanidation, roasting and leaching, by cupellation, by melting with zinc or by electrorefining. These methods either consume chemicals or require equipment of relatively high capital cost. The new method is cheap and simple and has the advantage that extraction and formation of copper powder is a concurrent process. The preferred method follows from FIG. 7 which merely illustrates the sequence of steps and involves a combination of reactions whose procedure is discussed elsewhere in this application, several solid-liquid separations and two thermal disproportionation steps, as herein described, thus a volatile nitrile is necessary and we illustrate this by discussing acetonitrile.\nFIG. 7 is a form of flow sheet in which the numerals refer to the following: 1 - a source of particulate material containing copper, silver and impurities e.g. lead, gold and iron, 2 - a solution of cupric sulphate, water, sulphuric acid and less than 35% by volume, preferably 15-25% by volume of a volatile organic nitrile, 3 - a leaching vessel for reaction 1, 4 - separation of solids and liquids, 5 - a solution of cuprous sulphate plus soluble impurities, 6 - solid materials containing silver, 7 - a solution of cupric sulphate, water, sulphuric acid and more than 35% by volume of a volatile organic nitrile, 8 - a solution of cuprous sulphate and silver sulphate, 9 - insoluble impurities e.g. lead, silica, 10 - system for cementing silver with particulate copper, 11 - metallic silver, 12 - a solution of cuprous sulphate, 13 - an apparatus for thermal disproportionation of cuprous sulphate solutions, 14 - removal of nitrile distillate and condensation, 15 - cupric sulphate in a nitrile depleted solution, 16 - copper powder, 17 - system for purifying electrolyte solution and adjusting its composition, 18 - removal of soluble impurities removed from the electrolyte in 17, 19 - system for washing silver with part of the solution numbered as 2 using solution bled off from 2.\nThe key feature of the preferred method is that copper in finely divided materials containing copper, 1 in FIG. 7 is oxidised by certain cupric salts in acidified mixtures, 2, of water containing less than 35% acetonitrile by volume (i.e. reaction 1), whereas a rapidly decreasing proportion of silver is oxidised as the proportion of acetonitrile in the composition decreases (i.e. reaction 9). Thus a composition, preferably saturated, but not excluding suspensions of certain cupric salts, acidified water, preferably 15 to 25% by volume and necessarily less than 35% by volume acetonitrile extracts copper, but very little silver, from a mixture containing copper and silver. In compositions containing more than 35% by volume acetonitrile, acidified water and preferably saturated with, but not excluding suspensions of, cupric salt, an increasproportion of silver is oxidised by Cu2 + with increasing proportions of acetonitrile, once all the copper has been dissolved. Thus, in the preferred procedure, once copper has been leached from a copper-silver mixture with a composition containing ca. 15 to 25% acetonitrile by volume, as described and shown to point 6 in FIG. 7, silver is leached separately with a composition, 7, of excess cupric salt, acidified water, and preferably 35 -60% by volume acetonitrile. the resulting Cu2 +, Cu+, Ag+solution is cemented, 10, with the appropriate proportion of copper powder to give silver. The cement silver is washed free of copper, step 19, with a dilute solution of cupric salt preferably in 15 to 25% acetonitrile-acidified water. The thermal disproportionation steps shown as in 13 in FIG. 7 are as described previously.\nPreferred salts are cupric sulphate in solutions acidified with sulphuric acid preferably at least 0.5% and more, preferably 2 to 5% by volume, or cupric nitrate, acidified with preferably <0.2 molar nitric acid. Higher concentrations of nitric acid cause oxidation of copper. Nitrates tend to be more soluble than sulphates, but sulphates are cheaper. Lead sulphates are insoluble whereas lead nitrate is much more soluble, which is a disadvantage for nitrates.\nA preferred method for materials containing silver, but no copper, is to leach directly with a composition of excess cupric salt, acidified water and more than 35% most preferably 45 to 60% by volume acetonitrile and continue the process as shown following Ag + Xi in FIG. 7. In estimating the amount of cupric salt required for this process, it should be remembered that many other reducing agents, Fe, Ni, Cd, Zn, but not lead, in the presence of sulphates, reduce Cu2 + more readily than does silver in nitrile-water mixtures. The presence of such species in the material containing silver and copper requires an appropriate proportion of cupric salt.\nSuitable and preferred materials for thermal and electrochemical disproportionation, and for reactions 1-13.\nThe following expressions have been used in this application and are now explained.\nSuitable Organic Nitriles\nAcetonitrile, 2-hydroxycyanoethane and acrylonitrile are suitable organic nitriles and are preferred with the reservations as to their volatility, stability and homogeneity of compositions noted for certain processes. Throughout the description and claims of this application we have referred to \"organic nitriles\", \"acrylonitrile\" and \"propionitrile\" while recognising that many organic nitriles, including acrylonitrile and propionitrile, are not miscible in all proportions with water. Most of our compositions and methods require homogenous solutions, so that it is to be understood that where necessary for homogeneity, the terms organic nitrile, propionitrile, and acrylonitrile include mixtures of these species with sufficient of a solubilizing agent, such as ethanol, to ensure homogeneity. The terms \"organic nitrile\" and \"volatile organic nitrile\" include mixtures of organic nitriles and of volatile organic nitriles respectively.\nWhether a nitrile other than acetonitrile, 2-hydroxycyanoethane, or acrylonitrile with solubilizing agent, is suitable or not for the purposes of this invention is decided by the following tests. Our use of the terms \"organic nitrile\", \"nitriles\", \"volatile organic nitrile\" and so on in the application refers only to those species of the general formula RCN which pass the following tests and to acetonitrile, acrylonitrile, propionitrile\nGeneral tests for nitriles ##EQU4## of the nitrile under test is stirred with 65 gm of water containing 5 ml of sulphuric acid. The stoppered solution should remain homogeneous over a period of 1 hour at 50\u00b0C.\n1a. If the solution is not homogeneous, up to 30 ml of ethanol is added. The stoppered solution should remain homogeneous for one hour at 50\u00b0C. If homogenous solutions cannot be prepared by these procedures then the nitrile is deemed unsuitable.\n2. To the homogeneous solutions, prepared either as in 1 or 1a, there is added 4 gm of CuSO4. 5H2 O and this is stirred with 2 gm of copper powder (minus 100 mesh) for 1 hour at 50\u00b0C. If the solution is still homogeneous, except for undissolved copper powder and has become colourless, very pale blue, or coloured with due regard for any coloured nitriles, then the nitrile has passed this test.\n3. The successful solutions from test 2 are flushed with nitrogen, stoppered and warmed at 50\u00b0 for 24 hr. If the solution is still homogeneous and colourless or very pale blue or coloured with due regard for any coloured nitriles and contains more than 1 \u00d7 104 ppm of copper by atomic absorption, then the nitrile has passed this test.\nSpecific tests for nitriles.\nWhether the nitrile is suitable for thermal disproportionation, e.g. as in winning or copper powder refining is further decided by its volatility.\n4. The solutions from successful tests 3 are slowly distilled through an efficient distillation column. In some cases the distillation is of a water-nitrile, in others, e.g. propionitrile, of an ethanol-nitrile azeotrope. If more than 75% of the nitrile can be distilled off below 90\u00b0C, as measured for example by vpc of the distillate, and if some copper powder is precipitated on complete removal of the nitrile, then the nitrile is deemed suitable for thermal disproportionation.\nNitriles which pass tests 1-3, but which cannot be distilled below 90\u00b0C in test 4, are deemed suitable only for electrochemical disproportionation methods. The nitriles of test 4, which distil below 90\u00b0 are defined as volatile and are suitable for methods of electrochemical and thermal disproportionation. Electrochemical disproportionation with a volatile nitrile was done on a laboratory scale by operating even at 50\u00b0 with an electrolyte containing 25% acetonitrile by volume under a layer of paraffin, and also by operating at about 20\u00b0C with acetonitrile in cells covered with plastic sheets, enclosing an atmosphere of nitrogen.\nThe following nitriles were tested and found not suitable, dicyanomethane, acetone cyanhydrin, hydroxy cyanomethane, phenylcyanomethane. In general terms, suitable organic nitriles are organic nitriles, (including if necessary an \"inert\" solubilizing agent) which when mixed with water and sulphuric acid maintain stable homogeneous solutions of cuprous sulphate, all components being in proportions suitable for the particular process. Commercially, a desirable attribute is that the nitrile should not decompose to an economically unacceptable extent under the conditions of reactions 1-13 or thermal or electrochemical disproportionation. For example, a nitrile possessing some other functional group (e.g. CHO) which was readily oxidised or reduced, might be unsuitable for cuprous winning or for the electrochemical processes. Other nitriles might be hydrolysed or polymerised by the aqueous acid solutions at a rate which was uneconomic at elevated temperatures, and thus be unsuitable economically for thermal disproportionation but be suitable for electrochemical disproportionation, which can operate at room temperature and below.\nAs previously explained, the term suitable organic nitrile includes mixtures of nitriles, for example, acetonitrile containing some acrylonitrile is a mixture offering economic advantages, because such mixtures are byproducts from acrylonitrile manufacture. Acrylonitrile however is only partly miscible with water, so small proportions of it, or inclusion in the composition of a suitable solubilizing agent (e.g. methanol) are necessary.\nPreferred organic nitriles are volatile acetonitrile and \"non-volatile\" 2-hydroxycyanoethane and to a lesser extent volatile propionitrile (with methanol or ethanol as a solubilizing agent) and acrylonitrile (with solubilizing agents).\nAs already noted, according to whether a thermal or an electrochemical disproportionation step is used, further preferences and requirements are necessary. Thus volatile stable acetonitrile is strongly preferred for processes involving thermal disproportionation, such as cuprous winning and copper powder refining, because a distillation step is involved and the water-acetonitrile azeotrope boils below 80\u00b0C. On the other hand, slightly less stable but higher boiling 2-hydroxycyanoethane is well suited to electrochemical processes, such as copper powder electro-refining, and cuprous electrowinning, because these electrochemical processes operate preferably at less than 50\u00b0C, but are less suited to rigorously sealed systems because of problems with cathode handling. If a sealed system cannot be used, nitriles of low volatility are preferred, e.g. nitriles with solubilizing functional groups (OH, CO2 H, NH2). Use of such nitriles does not remove the problem with air oxidation however, so a \"blanket\" of non-oxidising atmosphere is preferred.\nThe preference of 2-hydroxycyanoethane for electrochemical processes was made because it had an inert functional group (OH) which conferred water miscibility on the nitrile and produced a nitrile of low volatility. It is also relatively cheap to manufacture. It does give a higher solution resistance then acetonitrile however. other functional groups (e.g. SO3 -, CO2 -, -NR3 +) are less easy to introduce into organic nitriles, but are suitable in principle, provided that they pass our test of maintaining stable, hologeneous solutions of cuprous salts when mixed with water and suitable acids, all components being in proportions suitable for the particular process being used. For example, cyanoacetic acid does not pass our tests, because it forms a solid with cuprous sulphate, and the cyanohydrin of formaldehyde decomposed rapidly.\nInert solubilizing agents.\nThese are substances designed to produce homogeneous solutions of cuprous salts, acid, water and sufficient of suitable organic nitriles, in proportions suitable for the processes covered by this application. The term solubilizing agent in this application should be understood to refer to inert solubilizing agents.\nThey are used when the suitable organic nitrile is only partly miscible with water (e.g. with some proportions of propionitrile or acrylontrile). Solubilizing agents can be tested for as in tests 1a -4 described for determining suitable nitriles, with the solubilizing agent replacing the ethanol in 1a. The solubilizing agent should not drastically alter the electrical resistance of the electrolyte in the electrochemical processes and should be chemically inert or still effective under the conditions of the process. Preferred solubilizing agents are ethanol or methanol. As noted already, in this application, it is to be understood that terms such as \"suitable nitrile\" or \"volatile organic nitrile\" mean that the nitrile is accompanied by a solubilizing agent if necessary for homogeneity.\nSufficient of a suitable nitrile.\nFor the handling of solutions of cuprous salts, a nitrile judged suitable by the methods outlined above, must be present in sufficient proportion to stabilize the cuprous ion in water, but since the nitriles are costly, no more nitrile than is necessary for satisfactory operation of the particular process, is desirable.\nWe have found that in the absence of oxidising agents, e.g. oxygen, stable solutions of some cuprous salts can be prepared in water containing a suitable acid and between 2-3 moles of an organic nitrile per mole of cuprous ion. Oxidation is faster in solutions of low nitrile content (cf. Table 2), so that under normal operating conditions, where it is difficult to completely exclude air, between 5 and 6 moles of suitable nitrile per mole of Cu+ is preferred, if stable solutions are required.\nFor the thermal disproportionation processes there is little advantage in having more than 6 moles of volatile nitrile per mole of Cu.sup.+, because the nitrile must be distilled, but for the electrochemical processes, the efficiency, the quality of the cathodic deposit, the polarization, the operating voltage and the speed of the Cuhu 2+ production at the anode, versus Cu+ reduction by reaction 1, are all linked with the concentration of cuprous sulphate and the proportion of nitrile present. Thus, in the electrochemical processes, criteria in addition to those for stabilization of cuprous ion determine the proportion of nitrile used. The proportion of nitrile chosen may be greater than the 5-6 moles, per mole of Cu+, specified above. If there is too much nitrile in the electrochemical processes this imposes an unnecessarily high resistance on the electrolyte and hingers disproportionation which creates high operating voltages, so that more than 10 moles of nitrile per mole of Cu+ was seldom used. Electrochemical disproportionation does proceed at attractively low voltages in solutions containing just 3 moles of acetonitrile per mole of cuprous ion but the cathode quality suffers.\nFor some of the methods used to prepare solutions of cuprous salts higher proportions of nitrile are necessary to force appropopriate equilibria sufficiently to the right. It is preferable to adjust the compositions of such cuprous salt solutions, prior to electrochemical or thermal disproportionation, e.g. by adding water, acid, or by quickly distilling off nitrile.\nThus preferred compositions for reactions 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 13 contain about 5-6 moles of nitrile per mole of eventual cuprous ion in solution, but these reactions do proceed with down to 2.5 to 3 moles of nitrile per mole of cuprous ion, in the absence of oxygen or oxidising agents. In practical terms between 8 and 30% by volume of our preferred nitrile are preferred for these reactions. For the reactions 3 to 6 and 9 of cupric salts with copper sulphides and silver, at least 20% by volume of acetonitrile are required to give detectable amounts of cuprous ion so that aqueous solutions, preferably containing more than 30% v/v acetonitrile were preferred if reactions 3-6 were to proceed at a satisfactory rate and were to leach an acceptable copper value. Reactions 3 to 6 and 9 of course do proceed to some extent with a lower proportion of acetonitrile than 30% by volume and with other nitriles. Relevant data are in later Tables, dealing with reactions 3 to 6 and 9 and clearly the choice of the proportion of nitrile used will depend on a balance between losses of nitrile, the cost of nitrile, the size of the equilibrium constant, the method of disproportionation and the frequency of leaches with fresh cupric salt solution. Such a choice will vary in different situations.\nThroughout the description and claims of this application it is to be understood that where the use of an organic nitrile is described or claimed, unless stated otherwise, the amount of nitrile is sufficient to satisfy the requirement outlined above. A further limitation on the amount of nitrile is that it form homogeneous compositions.\nAdditives.\nHere we refer to a whole host of additives which are known to improve the quality of copper cathodes (cf. Butts) and change the nature of copper powders precipitated from cupric solutions by, for example, hydrogen. As yet, we have not fully tested additives other than thiourea, long chain salts of alkylaryl or alkylsulphonates, ammonium lignin sulphonates, sodium thiosulphate, and glue as part of this invention, but note that additives are desirable in both forms of disproportionation. We believe that any additive which improves cathode quality in \"cupric\" electrorefining is highly likely to influence cathode quality in electrochemical disproportionation. Alkylsulphonates include ammonium lignin sulphonates in this application and claims. Such additives are also likely to alter the physical properties of the copper powder precipitated in the thermal disproportionation, where discrete particles are highly desirable. In particular we note that copper seeds, 0.1% of sodium alkylaryl sulphonates (AVITONE) sodium thiosulphate, and ammonium lignin sulphonates (ORZAN) produce an improved crystalline precipitate from thermal disproportionation of cuprous salt solutions. Additives are preferred in proportions between 10 and 10,000 ppm.\nSuitable reducing agents.\nCuprous sulphate or CuHSO4 solutions are produced by reduction of cupric sulphate solutions in the presence of water, sulphuric acid and an organic nitrile. In principle those reagents which are known to reduce cupric ion to copper in water will reduce cupric to cuprous sulphate and often further to copper in the acidified water-nitrile mixture. However solubilities, side reactions and so on, sometimes prevent efficient formation of a suitable cuprous salt solution for the processes outlined in reduction reactions represented by reaction 8.\nThe following are regarded as suitable reducing agents and the term reducing agent refers to them in this application, unless stated otherwise, because they reduce cupric sulphate to solution of cuprous salts in acidified aqueous solutions containing sufficient acetonitrile to stabilise any cuprous ion (i.e. more than 2.5 moles of nitrile per mole of cuprous ion): iron, nickel, cobalt, copper, cadmium, zinc, tin, sodium metabisulphite, sulphur dioxide and sulphurous acid. Cuprous and cupric sulphide, nickel sulphide and silver are also suitable reductants in the presence of higher proportions of organic nitrile, as already discussed. The proportions of reductant are such as to satisfy the reduction Cu2 + \u2192 Cu+, (e.g. one half mole of iron reduces one mole of cupric sulphate to cuprous sulphate). A preferred reductant is sulphur dioxide or sulphurous acid at atmospheric pressure in the presence of a weak base and this reductant also reduces cupric carbonates or oxides, as noted for reaction 12, as well as cupric ammonium salts. At moderate temperatures and pressures (5 atmos. and 50\u00b0 - 100\u00b0C) no base is needed provided that the initial acidity is low, when SO2 is the reductant.\nCopper salts, cupric salts, cuprous sulphate, CuHSO4, certain suitable cuprous salts, and suitable acids.\nIn practice, this application deals with sulphates, sulphites, bisulphates, bisulphites and nitrates of copper. The acids are sulphuric, sulphurous or nitric. The solutions described in these processes as containing cuprous sulphate, CuHSO4, cuprous bisulphite, etc, have not had the said suprous salts isolated as solids, nor have the salts been identified, so we use the terms a little loosely. However we do know that the solutions contain cuprous ions and can give copper by disproportionation. We use the names for the solutions prepared as described herein because the method of preparation leads us to believe that they would be solutions of such salts. The term \"cuprous sulphate\" in both the application and claims include the bisulphate, and the CuHSO4 includes the sulphate. In the presence of SO2, other salts, such as CuHSO3 would be present when for example cupric sulphate was reduced. We note that CuHSO4 appears to be a more soluble species than Cu2 SO3. Likewise the reactions, 1 - 13, as represented by the equations, may not proceed exactly as specified by these equations. We have established however that when the reactants shown are mixed under the specified conditions, cuprous salt solutions are produced and that is the requirement of this invention.\nCuprous sulphate solutions containing sulphuric acid are a suitable salt and acid for all thermal and electrochemical disproportionations. Cuprous nitrate and a little nitric acid are suitable for some forms of thermal disproportionation at low acidities. More than 0.3N nitric acid dissolves some of the copper powder which is produced and oxidises cuprous ion. Thus cuprous nitrate solutions are undesirable for the electrochemical processes, for which strongly acid solutions are preferred. Nitrates tend to be more soluble than sulphates (Table 3) and so offer some advantages for thermal disproportionation in solutions containing less than 0.3 normal acid. Likewise it is undesirable to use cupric nitrate containing more than 0.3 normal nitric acid to generate solutions of cuprous nitrate, indeed with high nitric acid content it is impossible.\nCuprous sulphite is not very soluble in nitrile-water mixtures but cuprous bisulphite, or CuHSO3 mixed with CuHSO4 in sulphurous acid solutions are suitable for the thermal disproportionation step of some of the processes. \"Cupric sulphite\" or \"bisulphite\" is excluded from the copper salts described in this invention. Careful control of pH is needed to obtain solutions of cuprous bisulphite.\nAnions which form water insoluble cuprous salts and complex with cuprous ion, e.g. Cl-, CN-, S=, Br- do not allow solutions of cuprous salts of sufficient concentration for satisfactory disproportionation, and their salts are excluded from the \"cuprous salt solutions\" described in this application.\nIn principle, most soluble cuprous salts and acids of inert anions are suitable, but cuprous sulphate in sulphuric acid solutions are strongly preferred for disproportionation, especially for the electrochemical processes. The concentration of acid should not be so high as to cause uneconomic losses of nitrile by hydrolysis, but high enough to control impurities.\nSuitable inert anode for the electrochemical disporportionations\nThe voltage at which these processes operate depends on the nature of the anode and particularly on the efficiency of circulation of electrolyte about the anode. Dense graphite and carbon felt or cloth were suitable materials in well stirred solutions, with the first preferred, but in still solutions there is a substantial overvoltage at carbon anodes. Bright platinum or platinum-plated anodes allow the cell to operate at the lowest voltage of any anode studied by us with moderate stirring and at much the same voltage, whether the electrolyte is well stirred or not. They are preferred above all others for small scale operations, but where economic considerations demand other materials, carbon anodes, with good circulation about the anode, are preferred. Gold, or gold-plated anodes operate at slightly higher voltages than do bright platinuim anodes, but are satisfactory, although also expensive. Stainless steel anodes show a high overvoltage even when the anolyte is well circulated. The cupric salts tend to slowly remove nickel from the steel in the presence of nitriles, so steel anodes must be replaced at intervals. Lead anodes coated with PbO2 are not suitable, we think, because the PbO2 oxidises cuprous ion to cupric ion. There is also a high overvoltage at lead.\nThe ideal requirement for a preferred anode is that it be inert, i.e. effectively unchanged by the electrolyte under the conditions of electrolysis, and that it allows electrochemical disproportionation of cuprous salts at an economic voltage. Thus the choice of anode in an industrial process depends on a balance between the cost of power, the cost of materials (e.g. expensive films of platinum or gold) and the practicality of good anolyte circulation (necessary for carbon anodes but not so much for platinum coated anodes). For the purposes of this invention, a platinum anode is the best known to us, but for economic reasons, a dense graphite anode in a well stirred solution is recommended for large scale processes.\nSuitable materials containing copper\nReaction 1, especially as part of copper powder refining and copper powder electrorefining in principle, can be applied to most finely divided materials containing copper metal. Indeed massive copper reacts slowly by reaction 1. A limited amount of cuprous oxide with the copper can be treated by reaction 10 in conjunction with reaction 1, in the powder refining, provided that the acid and copper balance is maintained. Due regard should be paid to the chemistry of the impurities associated with the copper and in some cases these should be removed before reaction 1. Thus copper powder electrorefining could only be applied with difficulty to a material containing a high percentage of calcium carbonate because of reaction with the acid. Pretreatment e.g. with acid, would be necessary. Examples of materials we have found suitable for copper powder refining and reaction 1 follow. All were used as at least minus 16 mesh materials. Cupreous powder or cement copper (cf. Butts); atomised \"blister\" copper, scrap copper, and anode copper (each divided for example by atomising the molten material with steam, cf. Butts); tinned copper nuggets, copper alloys containing more than 65% copper (e.g. most brasses) as shavings; copper metal in slag heaps; the concentrate from the TORCO process, copper-lead drosses from lead smelters, and materials containing copper, silver and gold, e.g. anode slimes. Copper precipitated by hydrogen reduction from solutions of copper salts is thought to be suitable but was not tested.\nCopper powder electrorefining is best suited to materials of high copper content (more than 98% copper) but copper powder refining is in principle (with due regard to the chemistry of impurities, e.g. high proportions of iron) applicable to materials containing both large (e.g. blister copper) and moderate (e.g. TORCO concentrate) proportions of divided copper, because successive refining steps lead eventually to pure copper.\nThe rate of reaction 1 is very dependent on the particle size of the materials containing the copper. Reduction to a mesh size of 95% minus 16 plus 240 is preferred for all applications of reaction 1. If the particles are too fine, problems with filtration arise.\nReference to other materials like copper oxides and sulphides are intended to refer also to minerals, ores, mattes and so on, containing these materials. Their efficient leaching requires division preferably to smaller than 16 mesh. Such materials include cuprous sulphide, cupric sulphide, bornite, chalcocite, cuprous oxide, cupric oxide, chrysocolla, other copper sulphide ores, other oxidised copper ores, copper mattes, and anode slimes, provided that they are finely divided. The cupric sulphate from leaching of oxidised copper ores, copper ammonium salt solutions from ammoniacal leaching, the tankhouse electrolyte from cupric electrorefining, and oxidised copper rod for wire drawing are suitable materials for conversion to cuprous sulphate solutions by one or more of reactions 1-13 and subsequent reduction to copper powder or copper cathodes by disproportionation. As noted, chalcopyrite is not suitable unless pretreated to convert it to some other mineral.\nSuitable and preferred compositions.\nThermal and electrochemical disproportionation rely on a supply of homogenous solutions of suitable cuprous salts in acidified solutions of water containing an organic nitrile. A preferred general composition for disproportionation is cuprous sulphate assaying about 2-5% by weight Cu+, in water containing sulphuric acid and about 15 to 20% by volume of volatile acetonitrile, or \"non volatile\" 2-hydroxycyanoethane, with additives and seeds in the case of thermal disproportionation. The specific compositions are limited by such factors as the solubility of cuprous and cupric salts at appropriate stages of the process. They are limited by the relation between the proportions of nitrile required for solvation of the cuprous ion (minimum of 2 to 3 moles per mole of Cu+), by the concentration of cuprous ion needed to prevent polarization of the electrodes in the electrolytic methods, by the miscibility of the nitrile, by the suitability of the anion accompanying the cuprous cation, by the necessity to keep solutions at a suitable pH and by the desired purity and physical nature of the copper, which depends on the composition, especially in the electrochemical processes.\nWith these factors in mind, the following compositions are preferred for the processes noted. They may be made in part by one or more of the reactions 1-13.\nThermal disproportionation cuprous winning and copper powder refining.\nPrior to removal of the volatile nitrile, the solution preferably contains cuprous sulphate in any desired proportion consistent with its solubility and the availability of starting materials; water; sufficient sulphuric acid (preferably 1 to 2% by volume) to maintain acid conditions throughout the process, and between 2.5 and 10 moles (preferably 4 to 6 moles) of a suitable volatile organic nitrile per mole of cuprous ion present plus 10 to 10,000 ppm additives and copper seeds. For copper powder refining it may be more convenient to start with cupric sulphate in 1 to 4% by volume sulphuric acid, water, and between 7 and 20 moles of a volatile nitrile per mole of cupric ion, plus additives.\nPreferred compositions for reactions 1 to 13\nThese are indicated in the discussion of these reactions or in the examples, and in the claims specifying methods based on these reactions. A summary of preferred compositions follows, based on nitriles of relatively low molecular weight (40-100) and density 0.8-1.1, and also on the use of sulphates in the normal way, remembering the relationship (about 2.5:1) between moles of nitrile and moles of cuprous ion and the need for homogenous compositions.\n\n __________________________________________________________________________CuSO.sub.4      RCN.sup.b           H.sub.2 O.sup.a               H.sub.2 SO.sub.4Reaction%Cu.sup.2.sup.+ wt      % vol    % vol  Other.sup.c                            Reactant.sup.d__________________________________________________________________________1    0.5-5 8-30     0.5-4  --    Cu2    0.1-2 8-30     1-5    oxygen                            Cu3    2-5.sup.e      30-60    3-10   --     Cu.sub.2 S.sup.g4    0.5-2.sup.e      30-60    4-10   oxygen                             Cu.sub.2 S.sup.g5    2-5.sup.e      30-60    3-10   --    CuS.sup.g6    0.5-2.sup.e      30-60    4-10   oxygen                            CuS.sup.g7    >0.1  8-30     >0.5   SO.sub.2 /Base                             --8    0.5-5.sup.e      8-30     0.5-4  --     M9    0.5-4 35-60    0.5-4  --    Ag10   --    6-30     >2     --    Cu.sub.2 O11   --    95-98           --.sup.f               2-5    --     Cu.sub.2 S.sup.g12   >0.05 6-25     --     SO.sub.2                            CuO13   --    8-60     0.5-2  Ag.sup.+                            Cu__________________________________________________________________________ .sup.a) The composition was completed with water. .sup.b) RCN is a suitable nitrile and the percentage volumes should be adjusted for nitriles of much higher molecular weight and density than acetonitrile. .sup.c) The reactions also require these substances, i.e. saturated oxyge or SO.sub.2. d)Sufficient of the composition required to treat the quantity of available reactant, according to the stoichiometry of the equations is used, the reactants are finely divided solids containing these materials. .sup.e) Added in batches if liquids are not homogeneous. .sup.f) No water. .sup.g) Includes minerals and non stoichiometric copper sulphides.\nPreferred compositions for electrochemical disproportionation.\nThe preferred compositions contain a solution of cuprous sulphate assaying between 2 and 5% cuprous ion on a weight basis, water, 5 to 10% by volume sulphuric acid, and 3 to 8 moles of a suitable organic nitrile, preferably 2-hydroxycyanoethane or acetonitrile, per mole of cuprous ion. 2-hydroxycyanoethane requires higher voltage than acetonitrile. Additives (e.g. glue and thiourea and sodium alkylarylsulphonates) designed to improve cathode quality are desirable, in similar proportions to those used for cupric electrorefining.\nUpper limites on the Cu2 SO4 concentration are imposed by its solubility in the composition at the temperature of operation, lower limits by the need to have sufficient cuprous ion to prevent polarization of the electrodes at the current density and rate of stirring chosen. If these limits are exceeded, it is immediately obvious.\nThe concentration of sulphuric acid is determined at the lower limit by an acceptable low electrical resistance. The resistance increases with decreased concentration of acid. At the upper limit, the concentration of acid is determined by the efficiency of the process and the quality of the cathodes, both of which decrease as the concentration of acid rises above ca. 8% by volume.\nThe proportion of nitrile is determined by the need to stabilize the cuprous sulphate solution and to slow the oxidation (Table 2), so that at least 3 moles of nitrile per mole of cuprous ion, is preferred.\nThe following descriptions illustrate the preferred embodiments of the invention for processing copper via solutions of cuprous salts in acidified aqueous solutions of organic nitriles.\nA. Methods of preparing solutions of cuprous salts.\nReaction 1 - The following general procedure was used to obtain the data in Table 1. Materials (10-100 gm) containing copper as shown in Table 1 weighing sufficient to satisfy the stoichiometry of reaction 1, and of size minus 30 to plus 60 mesh were leached in a reaction vessel by stirring or shaking under an atmosphere of nitrogen at about 50\u00b0C, with 500-2000 ml solutions of AR grade cupric sulphate containing 30-40 gms/litre of cupric ions, 25-30% by volume acetonitrile, water, and between 1 and 2% by volume sulphuric acid. The reaction mixture usually contained about 3-4% by weight of solids, depending on the copper content of the materials. Leaching was continued until the copper values in the solution had reached a steady value. In nearly all cases this was less than forty minutes if the stirring was vigorous.\nThe progress of the reaction 1 was also monitored by the decrease in blue colour of the cupric sulphate and of course by disappearance of solid copper.\nThe solution of cuprous sulphate from reaction 1 was filtered and centrifuged and stored under nitrogen in a sealed vessel. Analysis of these cuprous solutions, based on ppm of the copper content, are compared with the purity of the original materials containing copper in Table 1.\nThe table also includes some analysis of the copper powder and copper cathodes produced by thermal and electrochemical disproportionation respectively of these solutions. For electrochemical disproportionation, the acidity was increased to 5% by volume sulphuric acid.\nVariation of conditions - The following variations of reaction 1, as specified, were performed using 2 gms of Mt. Isa blister copper (cf. Table 1) as feed and 100 ml of the composition. Unless stated otherwise, the blister copper had dissolved in less than 30 minutes to give cuprous solutions with similar assays as for the reaction with blister copper shown in Table 1. Many of the findings are relevant to other reactions and processes.\na. Variation of cupric salt - The cupric sulphate and sulphuric acid of reaction 1, were replaced with cupric nitrate and 0.1 molar nitric acid respectively, dissolution of copper to a colourless solution was rapid, copper was recovered by thermal disproportionation. If 0.5 molar nitric acid was used, the copper dissolved, but the solution was blue and contained mostly cupric nitrate due to the oxidation of cuprous nitrate. Nitric acid was consumed and copper could not be recovered by thermal disproportionation.\nb. Variation of nitrile - Reactions 1 proceeded to dissolve copper using (a) 30% by volume 2-hydroxycyanoethane, (b) 20% propionitrile plus 16% ethanol by volume, (c) 30% acrylonitrile plus 30% ethanol by volume (d) 20% acetonitrile plus 5% acrylonitrile by volume; in place of the 25% by volume of acetonitrile.\nc. Variation of temperature - Acetonitrile was hydrolysed to acetic acid and ammonium acetate within 24 hours in 2 molar sulphuric acid in a sealed tube at 100\u00b0C. 2-hydroxycyanoethane is reported to hydrolyse at a comparable rate. Solutions of acetonitrile, water, cuprous sulphate and 1N sulphuric acid, within the compositions claimed, had not lost detectable amounts of acetonitrile, following heating in sealed tubes at 50\u00b0C after 2 months. The acetonitrile-water azeotrope boils between 70 and 80\u00b0C the propionitrile-ethanol-water azeotrope at 79\u00b0C. These facts illustrate some possible upper limits to temperature, but within these limits a temperature which gives satisfactory solubility of CuSO4 and fast enough dissolution of copper, i.e. 50\u00b0C, was preferred for reaction 1. The half life was very roughly halved for every 10\u00b0C rise in temperature for dissolution of a given material with a given composition.\nTABLE 1\nPurity of cuprous solutions, prepared by reaction 1 and of copper powder and of copper cathodes prepared by thermal and electrochemical disproportionation of the same solutions.\n\n ______________________________________Impur-   Feed      Cu.sup.+soln.sup.a                       Powder .sup.b,f                                Cathode.sup.c,fities    ppm/Cu.sup.f              ppm/Cu    ppm/Cu  ppm/Cu______________________________________Blister.sup.jNi       150       150      1.5.sup.e                                <2.5Sb       24        --       2.7.sup.e                                --As       330       --       7.1.sup.e                                --Fe       63         60      <5       <5Pb       480       145      5.5.sup.e                                16Ag       212       1.6      <5       <1Bi       8         --       0.8.sup.e                                --Cement.sup.d,jFe       27,000    --       240.sup.e                                --Sn       6.000     --        75      --Cement .sup.h,jFe       1,500     1,200    <5       <5Anodes.sup.jBi       3         --       N.D..sup.e                                --Pb       50        --       0.6.sup.e                                --Sb       13        --       0.2.sup.e                                --Ag       144       --        5.sup.e --Se       10        --       0.7.sup.e                                --As       152       --       0.6.sup.e                                --Ni       234       --       0.1.sup.e                                --Fe       14        --       5.5.sup.e                                --Co       2         --       N.D..sup.e                                --Blister.sup.jBi       3         --       (< 0.1).sup.e,i                                --Pb       920       --       (2.1).sup.e,i                                --Sb       42        --       (0.1).sup.e,i                                --Sn       7         --       (N.D).sup.e,i                                --In       5         --       (N.D.).sup.e,i                                --Ag       172       --       (17).sup.e,i                                --Se       319       --       (0.5).sup.e,i                                --As       27        --       (<0.2).sup.e,i                                --Ni       388       --       (<0.1).sup.e,i                                --Co       9         --       (N.D).sup.e,i                                --Fe       9         --       (2.9).sup.e,i                                --Mn       0.2       --       (N.D.).sup.e,i                                --Tinned.sup.jSn       3%        --       1000(150).sup.i                                --Brass.sup.jPb       3.4%      0.22%     20       550Zn       36.1%     32.6%     50      18Sn       1,000     --       <200     <200Fe       1,890     2,000     10      <5Ag       61        5        <5       <5Cd       87         90      <1       <3Ni       1,320     1,300    <4       <4Torco.sup.d,jSb       3.8       --       0.16.sup.e                                --Pb       28         12      0.34.sup.e                                --Ni       105       180       ND.sup.e                                --Zn       40         40       6       --As       4.3       --        ND.sup.e                                --Ag       22.5      <1       <1.sup.e --Se       7.5       --        ND.sup.e                                --Ca       370       400      <6       --Mg       6,400     560       36      --Fe       10,000    3,250    11.5.sup.e                                --Bi       4.66      --       0.69.sup.e                                --Te       1.04.sup.e              --        ND      --Dross.sup.jPb       61%        5.5%     16      --Zn       18,000     2.7%    <4       --Fe       1,020     1,250    <2.5     --Ag       456       3         15      --As       4,600     --       920.sup.e                                --Ni       490       680      <2.5     --As Sludge.sup.jAs       35%        4%      400      <200Bi       3,300      44      <18      <18Sb       11,000    390      200       100______________________________________ .sup.a Prepared by the method of reaction 1 using the general procedure specified.

Variation of Acid Concentration and Proportions of cupric sulphate and copper. - The solubility and in part the chemistry of materials accompanying the copper (e.g. iron, antimony, tin, arsenic) as well as the solubility of cuprous and cupric sulphate in water-nitrile mixtures, were found to depend on the acidity. Thus CuHSO4 and Cu(HSO4)2 are more soluble than the sulphates, so higher proportions of copper in solution are possible at higher acidity. Copper arsenates precipitate and ferric, antimony and bismuth salts tend to hydrolyse and precipitate from the cuprous solutions if the acidity decreases, as it does in the presence of air. Basic cuprous salts also precipitate at pH 6-7 but redissolve as acid is added. Sulphate ion is a relatively strong base in solutions containing high proportions of nitrile. Oxygen is converted to base as it oxidises cuprous ion and thus decreases the acidity. Some details of oxidation are given in Table 2. The oxidising power of >0.2N nitric acid towards copper has already been noted. Heavily oxidised copper (e.g. cement copper) consumed a considerable amount of acid, so that about 5% by volume was preferred with adjustments as reaction proceeded.\nTABLE 2\nOxidation of Stirred Cuprous Sulphate Solutions in Acidified Acetonitrile-water mixtures at 25\u00b0C under an oxygen atmosphere at a pressure of 1 atm.

The behaviour of most salts in solutions of various acidities containing organic nitriles and more than 50% water, can be more or less predicted from their behaviour in aqueous solution, except that most salts, except those of Cu+, Ag+ and Au+, are less soluble than in water containing no organic nitrile.

The solubility at 25\u00b0C was about half that at 50\u00b0C. The amount of cuprous sulphate which can exist in aqueous solutions containing sulphuric acid and acetonitrile varies with the proportion of acetonitrile in solution, at least 2.5 moles of acetonitrile per mole of cuprous ion is needed. Slightly less cuprous solution can exist without disproportionation at lower acid strengths, e.g. 0.2% by volume.\nConcentrations of up to 17% Cu+ by weight as CuHSO4 were produced in acidified water containing 50-60% acetonitrile by volume at 50\u00b0C. The quantity of cupric sulphate required to produce this concentration via reaction (1) is greater than the solubility of CuSO4 in these compositions, but suspensions of CuSO4.5H2 O were sometimes used for reaction 1. As noted, sulphate ion in such compositions is a fairly strong base, and so reduces the acid strength effectively. If the subsequent application was thermal disproportionation, the cupric sulphate often precipitated at undesirable stages of the process. Thus lower amounts of CuSO4 and CuHSO4 were preferred in such cases. The greater solubility of cupric nitrate was an advantage when solubility problems arose.\ne. Variation of Nitrile Proportion. - The following results provide useful information. Significant proportions of cuprous sulphate were produced in acidified aqueous solutions containing as low as 3% acetonitrile by volume. Solutions of CuHSO4 containing up to 17% cuprous ion by weight were produced in acidified water containing 60% acetonitrile by volume at 50\u00b0C. Acetonitrile was not miscible in all proportions with water containing a high concentration of electrolytes, particularly ferrous, nickel, cupric and cobalt sulphates. If two layers formed, more water was added or less salt was used. The rate of oxidation of cuprous solutions depended to some extent on the proportion of nitrile (cf. Table 2). Thus oxidation was slower in 30% acetonitrile by volume than in 10% acetonitrile-water, for a solution 1.5% by weight in Cu+. However if the subsequent use of the solution is thermal disproportionation, unnecessary energy was consumed in distilling excess nitrile, and if electrochemical disproportionation, voltages were higher with increasing nitrile. Also losses of expensive nitrile are increased if this solution contains high proportions of nitrile, so a balance had to be achieved and 15-30% by volume organic nitrile was commonly used.\nf. Behaviour of impurities. - Representative examples of most materials which are only slightly soluble in water acidified with sulphuric acid, have been found to be also only slightly soluble in acidified water-orangic nitrile mixtures containing cupric salts. Thus gold, antimony, mercury, lead, carbonaceous material (e.g. wood and coal), sand, bauxite, sulphur, lead sulphate, silver chloride, metastannic acid and paraffin were found not to dissolve significantly in the compositions specified for reaction 1. Thus copper can be leached from such materials by reaction 1 as confirmed in part by the results in Table 1. The other materials were left as residues.\nRepresentatives of many water soluble salts, oxidisable metals and many basic species were found to dissolve in the compositions. Thus iron, tin, nickel, cadmium and zinc, sodium chloride and limestone or oxides of copper, nickel and iron dissolved to some extent in the acidic compositions. In most cases such dissolved species remained in solution during subsequent disproportionation, of the cuprous solution to recover copper, provided that the pH was held more or less constant. Control of pH to relatively low values (<2) was especially important when arsenic, iron, bismuth or antimony salts were present. Some problems which arose are indicated.\nSoluble salts whose anions form insoluble cuprous salts, such as sodium halides and cyanide, were leached from the copper, preferably with hot water, before reaction 1, for optimum recovery of copper.\nSilver was found to dissolve in compositions of high nitrile content in the presence of excess cupric salt and precipitate as the nitrile content was lowered, e.g. by thermal disproportionation, so silver was cemented from solutions containing silver and cuprous sulphate with copper, prior to disproportionation. Silver contamination was greater in solutions of higher acidity.\nSolutions of relatively high acidity were used to leach copper from materials containing large proportions of iron, oxygen, carbonate, bismuth, arsenic, or antimony and the acidity was kept high throughout processing, if large amounts of iron, arsenic or antimony were present.\nIf large quantities of foreign salts were present, (e.g. CoSO4, NiSO4, FeSO4) the nitrile-water mixtures sometimes separated into two layers. In such cases the materials were pretreated with acidified water to remove such salts, or a greater volume of a composition containing more water was used.\nTin dissolved according to reaction 8, when tin was present in the material containing copper. The resulting stannous sulphate solution presumably was oxidised to stannic salts, during thermal disproportionation of the cuprous salt, and insoluble tin salts, presumably metastannic acid, contaminated the copper produced by thermal disproportionation.\nThis problem was partly solved by performing reaction 1 a second time, when the copper was leached from a white solid, presumably the now insoluble tin salts, to give purer cuprous sulphate solutions. Boiling with excess cupric sulphate converted soluble stannous to insoluble stannic salts which precipitated before disproportionation and were filtered off.\ng. Effect of particle size and solid-liquid density. - Reaction 1 was >90% completed in less than 20 minutes at 50\u00b0C when material, containing high proportions of copper, of minus 60 mesh, and present at about 4% by weight of the reaction mixture, were well agitated with the compositions specified for reaction 1.\nThe rate of dissolution slowed markedly as the particle size increased and particles +16 mesh usually took more than 1 hour to dissolve. Extremely fine material, (e.g. -250 mesh), was difficult to handle and filter and also was heavily oxidised, so that material -30 to +100 mesh was preferred for reaction 1.\nExample. - 20 gm of copper concentrate (analysing 75% copper) prepared by the TORCO process from Nchanga Consolidated Copper Mines and supplied by Copper Refineries Pty. Ltd., was -60 mesh and was stirred with 60 gm of CuSO4.5H2 O in 100 ml of acetonitrile, 250 ml of water and 10 ml of sulphuric acid at 50\u00b0C for 1 hour under nitrogen. The solution was filtered and distilled slowly under nitrogen to give 11.4 gms of copper. The residue was 5.6 gms containing 0.39 gms of copper. Thus the extraction was 97.4% of the available copper. A partial analysis of the original TORCO copper, the extracted solution and the copper powder produced by thermal disproportionation is in Table 1. The increased residue may be due to sulphates formed during the leach.\nReaction 2. - Reaction 1 was repeated with 5 gm of -30 + 100 mesh copper powder using 100 ml of solution containing 1 gm per liter of cupric ion (i.e. less than stoichiometric) at 25\u00b0C with good stirring under a slight positive pressure of oxygen, with 5% sulphuric acid by volume but otherwise as described for general reaction 1. Two gm of copper dissolved in 100 ml of solution over a period of ninety minutes to give a very pale blue solution of cuprous sulphate. The rate of reaction of oxygen with cuprous ion was slow (cf. Table 2) so that it was possible to maintain a very pale blue reaction mixture. ##EQU5## Examples (a) Leaching of Cuprous Sulphide. - One gram of finely divided (-100 mesh) cuprous sulphide and materials containing cuprous and sulphide ions were stirred for about 8 hours by gentle reflux at about 70\u00b0-75\u00b0C under nitrogen with more than a twofold excess of cupric sulphate, (i.e. 3% Cu2 + by weight) in 50 ml of 50% by volume acetonitrile, 5% sulphuric acid by volume and 45% water. The solution was separated from solids including some sulphur, and was stored in a sealed vessel. The reaction proceeded readily with all materials tested, other than chalcopyrite, as shown in Table 4. Complete separation of fine sulphur was difficult to achieve and traces reacted with copper in subsequent disproportionations. The conditions specified are too vigorous for reaction 3 alone and as seen in Table 4, reaction 5 also took place, so that the reaction can be regarded as Cu2 S + 2Cu2 + \u20e1 4Cu+ + S.\nTABLE 4\nLeaching of cuprous ions from cuprous and sulphide ions.\nReaction 3 and 5, over 8 hours at 70\u00b0-75\u00b0C.\n\n ______________________________________                % Cu        % Cu                extracted.sup.c,d                            extractedMaterial.sup.a        % Cu.sup.b                Reaction 3  Reaction 4.sup.c,d______________________________________1  Cu.sub.2 S        80      120-160     1902  Bornite   30      140-150     --3  Cu Matte  38      130-160     1904  Digenite  60      100-140     --5  Djurleite 80      120-140     1906  Chalcopyrite        30      30-45        74______________________________________ .sup.a Samples were minus 100 mesh provided by the Geology Department, Australian National University. .sup.b Analysed by leaching with aqua regia, % Cu in material. .sup.c Percentage of copper extracted, based on percentage available from reaction (3) or (4) i.e. 50% of total copper. .sup.d Percentages are higher than 100% in cases where reaction 5 follows reaction 3 (vide infra) and figures represent equilibrium values. Reactio 3 was complete in less than 8 hours with most materials (vide infra) and was fast with pure cuprous sulphate (see Table 5). Range of values represents results from three experiments with different stirring. These results were obtained before we realised that reaction 3 plus 5 was an equilibrium, less vigorous conditions are satisfactory.\nb. Leaching of copper matte. - A sample of 2 gm of copper matte, supplied by the Mt. Lyell Company, assaying 38% copper was ground to -100 mesh and was refluxed for 1 hour with 4.0 gm of CuSO4.5H2 O, 5 ml of sulphuric acid, 50 ml of acetonitrile and 50 ml of water under nitrogen. The copper content of the solution had increased by 0.44 grams. Thermal disproportionation gave 0.22 grams of copper powder, which is slightly more than 100% recovery based on reaction 3, i.e. reaction 5 is also operative.\n50 gm of copper matte supplied by Mt. Isa Mines Pty. Ltd., containing 24 gm of copper values was ground to minus 100 mesh and vigorously stirred for 1 hour at 50\u00b0C under a nitrogen atmosphere in a sealed reaction vessel with a composition of 160 gm of CuSO4.5H2 O, 1 liter of acetonitrile, 800 ml of water and 200 ml of sulphuric acid.\nThirty-four gm of a black solid containing 10.6 gm of copper and 2.1 gm of elemental sulphur remained. The liquor was filtered off and thermally disproportionated to give 5.2 gms of copper powder, contaminated with a little cuprous sulphide. Thus 13.4 gms of copper was leached, corresponding to a little more than a quantitative reaction 3. The residue was leached a second time with a fresh cupric sulphate solution to leach a further 12% of the available copper.\nc. Effect of Variables. - Reaction 3 was performed over 1 hour with 1 gm sample of -60 mesh cuprous sulphide under an inert atmosphere.\nThe proportions of acid, cupric sulphate and acetonitrile were varied, as was the temperature. Higher yields of copper were extracted than is expected from reaction 3 because of reaction 5. Results are in Table 5. The equilibrium constant for both reactions increased as the nitrile proportion increased.\n\n ______________________________________              H.sup.+Reaction 3   Cu.sup.2.sup.+ + Cu.sub.2 S              \u20e1                     2Cu.sup.+ + CuS   plus              H.sup.+Reaction 5   CuS + Cu.sup.2.sup.+              \u20e1                     2Cu.sup.+ + S i.e. Cu.sub.2 S + 2Cu.sup.2.sup.+                     \u20e1      4Cu.sup.+ + S______________________________________\n\n Reaction 4. - 2Cu.sub.2 S + 2H.sup.+ + 1/20.sub.2 Cu.sup.2.sup.+ 2 Cu.sup.+ + H.sub.2 O + 2CuS\nThis reaction was performed exactly as described for reaction 3, example (a), except that cupric sulphate assaying 1% Cu2 + by weight was used and reaction proceeded with stirring under a positive pressure of oxygen. The acid concentration dropped and the solutions were a pale blue. Results are shown in Tables 4 and 5. The reaction provided a more efficient leach than reaction 3, we think because cuprous ions are removed by oxidation to cupric ions, allowing equilibrium to proceed further to the right.\nExample (Reaction 4 and 6). - Twenty-five gms of minus 60 mesh cuprous sulphide was stirred with 19.6 gms of CuSO4.5H2 O in 600 ml of acetonitrile, 120 ml of sulphuric acid, and 480 mls of water under oxygen at 1 atmosphere and 50\u00b0C. The experiment was repeated with 20.0 gms of copper matte containing 11.9 gms of copper of minus 60 mesh. The solutions were sampled at different times with the results shown in Table 5.\nTABLE 5\nReaction 4 and 6 of cupric sulphate with cuprous sulphide and copper matte under oxygen at 1 atmosphere at 50\u00b0C.\n\n ______________________________________                        % Cu extractedtime    % Cu extracted from Cu.sub.2 S                        from mattemins    Reaction 4.sup.a     Reaction 4.sup.a,b______________________________________zero    84%                   77% 25     116                   86 60     148                   94 180    174                  106 300     178.sup.c           110______________________________________ .sup.a A value of 100% corresponds to quantitative reaction 4, a value of 200% corresponds to quantitative reaction 4 plus 6, i.e. complete leachin of all the available copper. .sup.b For the purpose of the calculation it is assumed that the copper i the copper matte is all present as cuprous sulphide, but this was not established. .sup.c The residue contained 3.4 gms of sulphur and 0.8 gms of sulphur were in solution, i.e. 84% of the available sulphur. .sup.d Matte supplied by Mt. Isa Mines Pty. Ltd.\nIn summary: (i) Reaction 3 proceeded readily to its equilibrium value at 25\u00b0C provided sufficient acid was present. A temperature of 50\u00b0 was preferred because usually the slower reaction 5 was also desired. (ii) Both acid and cupric sulphate were necessary for optimum reaction and about 5% by weight of cupric sulphate, plus about 5% by volume sulphuric acid was preferred. (iii) The extraction was more efficient (i.e. equilibrium was further to the right) in a given time, the greater the proportion of acetonitrile and about 40% by volume was preferred. (iv) A solid-liquid ratio of 2% solids was quite satisfactory.\n\n ______________________________________                   H.sup.+Reaction 5.

Sulphur was shown to react with cuprous ion in certain compositions to precipitate black(CuS?) and give a blue solution.\nSome hydrolysis and polymerisation of the acetonitrile occur at high acidities and temperatures, as shown by the odour of acetic acid, so that this was balanced against the kinetics of the leaching process. There was a detectable reaction at 25\u00b0C, but most reactions were performed at 60\u00b0-70\u00b0C. In some cases, with high proportions of cupric sulphate the nitrile and water separated into two layers. More water was added, or less cupric sulphate was used, with subsequent addition as reaction proceeded. The effect of some variables, temperature, acidity, nitrile proportion, and concentration of cupric sulphate is shown in Table 7 and have also been indicated by data in Tables 4 and 6. In the experiment, 1.0 gms of -100 mesh cupric sulphide was refluxed at 70\u00b0-78\u00b0C, with the compositions shown, in a leaching vessel under a nitrogen atmosphere for 1 hour, unless stated otherwise. The solution was filtered, then thermally disproportionated to give the yields of copper shown. It was desirable to have an excess of sulphuric acid over cupric sulphate because of the basicity of sulphate ion in the high nitrile compositions.\nTABLE 6\nLeaching of copper from cuprous sulphide by reaction 3 and 5a.\n\n ______________________________________[CuSO.sub.4.5H.sub.2 O]     [MeCN]   [H.sub.2 O]                       [H.sub.2 SO.sub.4 ]                               % Cugm        ml       ml       ml      extracted.sup.c______________________________________5.00      25       25       0.05    555.00      25       25       1.0     955.00      25       25       2.5     1255.00      25       25       5.0     145 5.00.sup.b     30       20       2.5     110.sup.b5.00      30       20       2.5     1605.00      20       30       2.5     955.00      10       40       2.5     451.00      10       40       0.25    25--        25       25       5.0     70--        25       25       2.5     651.00      --       50       0.25     9--        --       50       0.25    15______________________________________ .sup.a) Reactions are under reflux at 70-75\u00b0C, unless stated otherwise, for one hour and thus virtually oxygen free. .sup.b) Reaction performed for one hour at 25\u00b0C under nitrogen. .sup.c) Based on that expected from reaction 3, values greater than 100% are due to reaction 5.\nIt was important to remove sulphur from the cuprous solution prepared by reaction 5 before thermal disproportionation, because sulphur reacted with copper powder to give a black solid under the conditions of disproportionation.\nTABLE 7\nLeaching of Copper Values from 1.0 gm Cupric Sulphided,k.\n\n __________________________________________________________________________(CH.sub.3 CN) (H.sub.2 O)      (H.sub.2 SO.sub.4)            (CuSO.sub.4.5H.sub.2 O)                    % Cu % Cuml    ml   ml    gm      leached.sup.c                         precipitated.sup.e__________________________________________________________________________Under nitrogen at 1 atmosphere. 20.sup.i 75   5     5.0     40.sup.i                         --30    65   5     3.3     53.sup.j                         10 40.sup.i 55   5     5.0     89.sup.i                         --50    45   5     3.3     67   40 50.sup.i 45   5     5.0     95.sup.i                         --70    25   5     3.3     77.sup.j                         6070    25   5     5.0     70.sup.j                         --70    25   5     5.0     85.sup.j                         -- 70.sup.a 25   5     3.3     37.sup.a                          40.sup.a70    25   --    3.3     43   1070    25   1     3.3     90   5070    25   3     3.3     --   6070    25   5     5.0     85   --70    25   5     --      --   1050    45   5     5.0     63   --50    45   5     3.3     67   -- 50.sup.b 45   5     3.3     95   -- 50.sup.b 45   5     5.0     82   --  50.sup.b 45   5     1.0     51   --  50.sup.a,i 45   5     5.0     71.sup.a,i                         --Oxygen under pressure.sup.f.50    45   5     5.0     92.sup.h25    70   5     5.0     45.sup.h 0    95   5     5.0     31.sup.h__________________________________________________________________________ Footnotes: .sup.a At 25\u00b0C. .sup.b At 50\u00b0C. .sup.c Increased copper (as Cu.sup.2.sup.+ or Cu.sup.+) following the leach, as measured by atomic absorption expressed as a percentage of the 0.63 gms expected for complete leach of 95% pure CuS. .sup.d Samples were minus 100 mesh and were stirred under reflux (about 70\u00b0C) for one hour unless stated otherwise. .sup.e Percentage of copper recovered from the leach solution after filtering and evaporating off the acetonitrile (thermal disproportionation), based on 0.63 gms of copper being available from Cu.sup.2.sup.+ + CuS \u2192 2Cu.sup.+ + S \u2192 Cu + Cu.sup.2.sup.+ S.

(ii) Both acid and cupric sulphate are necessary for efficient reaction. (iii) The efficiency of extraction increased (i.e. the equilibrium lay further to the right) with an increased proportion of acetonitrile. (iv) Care had to be taken to ensure homogenous solutions in compositions high in acetonitrile and cupric sulphate. (v) The reverse reaction 5 prevented a quantitative leach in reactions producing high proportions of cuprous ion and sulphur.\nExample. - (Reaction 5). Twenty-five gm of minus 60 mesh freshly prepared cupric sulphide was stirred in a reaction vessel under reflux for one hour with a composition of 110 gm of CuSO4.5H2 O, 1100 ml of acetonitrile, 1000 ml of water, and 110 ml of sulphuric acid. The blue colour rapidly decreased in intensity and coagulated sulphur was observed.\nThe solution was filtered to leave 5 gm of a grey material, containing 0.15 gm of copper, soluble in carbon disulphide and which gave yellow sulphur on evaporation of the carbon disulphide. The filtrate contained 44 gms of copper, corresponding to a quantitative reaction 5.\nIt was thermally disproportionated to give 9 gms of copper powder, contaminated with a little cuprous sulphide.\nReaction 6. - Reaction 5 was repeated using the conditions for Table 7 but under an atmosphere of oxygen. This had the effect of oxidising the cuprous to cupric ions and consuming some acid (cf. Table 2). It prevented the back reaction 5. Sulphur was produced by this procedure. Some results are included in Table 7 under footnote j.\nThe reaction 6 was also carried out in a bomb with a pressure of 100 p.s.i.g. oxygen. Deep blue solutions of cupric sulphate rather than colourless cuprous sulphate were produced, due to oxidation of the cuprous ion produced by reaction 6. Results are also in Table 7. Some reactions 6,  following reaction 4, are illustrated in Table 5.\nReaction of sulphur with cuprous ion and demonstration that 5 is an equilibrium. - (a) A solution of cuprous sulphate, assaying 40 gms/liter cuprous ion in 45 ml of water, 50 ml of acetonitrile and 5 ml of sulphuric acid was refluxed with 1 gm of sulphur. A black precipitate and a deep blue solution was formed within 5 minutes, presumably because of the reactions:\n\n 4Cu.sup.+ + S \u20e1 Cu.sup.2.sup.+ + 2Cu.sup.+ + CuS \u20e1 Cu.sub.2 S + 2Cu.sup.2.sup.+\nb. The above solution of cuprous sulphate, assaying 40 gms/liter cuprous ion, was refluxed for one hour with 1.7 gm of minus 100 mesh cupric sulphide, 5 gms of CuSO4.5H2 O and 3 ml of sulphuric acid. Only 0.5 gms of copper were extracted. An identical experiment, without cuprous sulphate, but the same proportions of water, acetonitrile, sulphuric acid, and cupric sulphate, leached all the copper from 1.7 gms of cupric sulphide.\nc. Sulphur dissolved in refluxing 50% acetonitrile, 45% water, 5% sulphuric acid to the extent of about 0.05 gms/100 ml.\nMethod of Leaching chalcopyrite concentrates. - Fifty gm of a chalcopyrite concentrate containing 26% copper by weight and supplied by Mt. Isa Mines Pty. Ltd. of Queensland was heated in a sealed vessel with 6 gms of powdered sulphur at 480\u00b0C for 5 hours. The product was ground to minus 60 mesh and analysed for iron and copper. 0.5 gm of this material was refluxed with 50 ml of a solution containing 2.5 gm of cupric sulphate, 5% sulphuric acid by volume, 50% acetonitrile by volume and 45% water by volume, for 2 hours. Analysis of the residue showed that 90% of the copper content and less than 10% of the iron had been extracted.\nAs shown already, (Table 4) chalcopyrite was not significantly leached of its copper under these conditions and it is thought that heating with sulphur converts the chalcopyrite to cupric sulphide and pyrite, to give a mixture more readily leached of its copper by reaction 5.\n\n Reaction 7. - 3SO.sub.2 + 4H.sub.2 O + 2Cu.sup.2.sup.+ \u20e1 2Cu.sup.+ + H.sub.2 SO.sub.4 + 2H.sub.2 SO.sub.3 + 2H.sup.+.\nThis reaction did not proceed satisfactorily in acidic solutions containing acetonitrile and water saturated with sulphur dioxide at normal temperature and pressure. The reaction gave higher yields of cuprous ion in acidified solutions (about 1N H2 SO4) under pressure of 4-8 atmospheres at 50\u00b0-100\u00b0C, but even then did not proceed to completion. A complication is that cuprous sulphite was only slightly soluble in the solutions, whereas the bisulphite, CuHSO3, was much more soluble. Thus it was important to control the pH during reduction and this was done very effectively by adding a salt of a weak acid, e.g. ammonium acetate or calcium carbonate. We used some salts, which play a dual role as a source of reducing agent and buffer, e.g. sodium bisulphite, or sodium metabisulphite, or acidified sodium sulphite and obtained quantitative reductions of cupric salt to cuprous bisulphite in water-organic nitrile mixtures. Salts of the cupric ammonium ion were reduced to solutions of cuprous bisulphite with excess SO2 in the presence of at least 2.5 moles of nitrile per mole of potentially reducible cupric ion.\nThe following examples illustrate the reactions. Examples of thermal disproportionation of the resulting cuprous solutions are included.\nExamples (a) - (c) and (h) illustrate preferred methods.\na. Ten g. of CuSO4 .5H2 O was stirred for 20 minutes with 30 ml of acetonitrile, and 70 ml of water saturated with SO2 containing 5 g. of ammonium acetate in a sealed reaction vessel. A pale green solution was formed. This was filtered to give a green cuprous salt solution which was analysed by thermally disproportionating it to give a copper precipitate, containing some Cu2 SO3. This was filtered off and the solid was washed with 10 ml of 1N sulphuric acid. A blue solution was formed and 1.20 gm of copper was deposited, i.e. a quantitative yield, based on cuprous disproportionation.\nb. The reaction was repeated, but adding 5 gm of calcium carbonate in place of the ammonium acetate in an open vessel. Carbon dioxide was evolved and a precipitate, thought to be CaSO4, was formed. The solution of cuprous salts was filtered off and the precipitate was washed with 30% acetonitrile-water, the two solutions were combined and thermally disproportionated to give 1 gm of copper, after washing the precipitated copper with 1N sulphuric acid.\nc. Five gm of CuSO4.5H2 O was reduced by stirring it for 20 minutes in 15 ml of acetonitrile, plus 35 ml of water, saturated with sodium metabisulphite in a sealed vessel. A pale green solution of cuprous salts was formed. This was acidified with 2 ml of sulphuric acid and thermally disproportionated. The residue was washed with 1N sulphuric acid to give 0.5 gm of metallic copper (80% yield).\nd. Ten gm of CuSO4.5H2 O was reduced by shaking it for 2 hours with 15 ml of acetonitrile and 50 ml of water saturated with SO2 at atmospheric pressure. As the CuSO4 reacted and dissolved, more SO2 was bubbled into the solution. The solution was thermally disproportionated and the solid washed with sulphuric acid to give 0.55 gms of copper (<40% yield).\ne. Experiment (d) was repeated in the presence of 10% v/v H2 SO4. The yield dropped to 0.05-0.1 gms. (4-8%).\nf. Experiment (d) was repeated with SO2 saturated at 6 atmospheres and at 100\u00b0C (by saturating the solution at room temperature, sealing and heating to 100\u00b0C). The yield of copper had increased to 1.0 gms. (80%).\ng. Experiment (f) was repeated in the presence of 10% v/v H2 SO4. The yield of copper decreased to 20%.\nh. A solution of cupric sulphate in 100 ml of water was treated with ammonia to give a deep blue solution. Fifty ml of acetonitrile was added and the solution was saturated with SO2. As more SO2 was added the solution changed from blue to green to yellow and the pH decreased. The yellow solution was thermally disproportionated to give some copper powder.\n\n Reaction 8. - M + 2Cu.sup.2.sup.+ \u2192 M.sup.2.sup.+ + 2Cu.sup.+ (M = Fe, Ni, Cd, Co, Zn, Sn).\nExamples of reaction 8 and thermal disproportionation of resulting solutions.\na. A solution of cupric sulphate, assaying 5% by weight Cu2 +, in 25 ml of acetonitrile, 2 ml of sulphuric acid and 73 ml of water at 50\u00b0C in a sealed reaction vessel under nitrogen was shaken with 0.5 gm of the powdered metals (about -60 mesh) until the metals dissolved to give a clear solution. The results are shown in Table 8.\nTABLE 8\nReduction of Cupric sulphate to cuprous sulphate and complete dissolution of metals by reaction 8.\n\n ______________________________________          Time         [Cu.sup.+].sup.cmetal          mins.sup.b   %______________________________________Fe.sup.a       80           89%Ni             60           100%Cd             60           60%Zn.sup.a       40           66%______________________________________ .sup.a) Hydrogen was also evolved. .sup.b) This is the time for complete dissolution. .sup.c) Cu.sup.+ found, following complete dissolution of the metal, expressed as a percentage of Cu.sup.+ expected for a quantitative reactio 8.\nb. An iron nail weighing 0.92 gms was shaken with a solution of cupric sulphate assaying 2% by weight Cu2 + in 30 ml of acetonitrile, 5 ml of sulphuric acid and 70 ml of water in a sealed vessel at room temperature. The nail dissolved completely within 24 hours. The solution was colourless and no copper powder could be detected in the reaction vessel. The solution was filtered and was thermally disproportionated to give 0.92 gms of copper containing 0.005% iron.\nA duplicate experiment, with 30 ml of water replacing all the acetonitrile and only 1% by weight Cu2 +, gave a copper coated nail in a still blue solution containing 0.5% by weight Cu2 +. The copper coated nail still contained significant amounts of iron at its centre, and the solution was still blue after 5 days. Thus aqueous cementation was much less effective.\nc. 200 mls of the tankhouse electrolyte from Copper Refineries Pty. Ltd. containing 8 gms of Cu2 + and 10% v/v sulphuric acid in water was treated with 50 ml of acetonitrile and 4 gms of iron powder. A little hydrogen was evolved until the iron became coated with copper, and after 2 hours the blue cupric colour had been discharged leaving a pale green cuprous and ferrous sulphate solution. This was filtered and thermally disproportionated to give 4.1 gms of copper powder, containing 30 ppm iron.\nThe dissolution of metal sulphates in nitrile-water mixtures depends of course on the solubility of these metal sulphates, but nickel, iron, cadmium and cobalt sulphates are all very soluble in acidified acetonitrile-water (Table 3).\nd. Extraction of nickel and thermal disproportionation of the resulting cuprous solution. - 0.5 gms of nickel powder, -100 mesh, was shaken in a reaction vessel at room temperature with 100 ml of a suspension of 5 gms of CuSO4.5H2 O in 25 ml of acetonitrile, 2 ml of sulphuric acid and 73 ml of water for 2 hours in a sealed vessel. The greenish solution was filtered and thermally disproportionated in a precipitation vessel to give 0.43 gms of copper. The liquor containing cupric and nickel sulphates was reconstituted with the water-acetonitrile azeotrope from the thermal disproportionation plus 2.5 gms of CuSO4.5H2 O, and the acidity was adjusted to about 1N with sulphuric acid. A further 0.5 gms of nickel powder was oxidised in the same reaction vessel, as described above, with this composition, the solution was transferred to the precipitation vessel and then the Cu+ was thermally disproportionated to give 0.40 gms of copper.\nThe resulting solution was cooled and cemented with nickel powder to slowly give 0.4 gm copper and a solution of NiSO4 containing <200 ppm copper. The experiment was repeated with 1.0 gm of nickel matte, supplied by Western Mining Corporation to give nickel solutions and copper powder.\ne. Extraction of other salts. - This general procedure was repeated with 0.5 gm portions of powdered (90% minus 16 mesh) cadmium and cobalt to generate copper and solutions of CdSO4 and CoSO4.\n\n Reaction 9. - Cu.sup.2.sup.+ + Ag \u20e1 Cu.sup.+ + Ag.sup.+.\nThis reaction depends on having sufficient nitrile present for equilibrium to be sufficiently to the right. It appears to be slower than corresponding reaction 1. The relationships between redox potential of the couples Cu/Cu+, Ag/Ag+, and Cu2 + /Cu+, change markedly with the proportion of acetonitrile in a water-acetonitrile mixture containing the sulphates of these ions.\nTwo examples of the reaction, using a preferred method follows:\na. 0.5 gm of silver powder (-100 mesh) was stirred with 2 gms of CuSO4.5H2 O in a composition of 25 ml of acetonitrile, 25 ml of water and 3.5 ml of H2 SO4 at 50\u00b0C. The silver dissolved within 30 minutes. Addition of copper powder rapidly cemented silver. This was washed with a solution of 5 gm CuSO4.5H2 O in 10 ml of acetonitrile, 35 ml of water and 5 ml of H2 SO4 to leave a residue of 0.48 gms of silver containing <1% copper.\nb. An artificial mixture made up of -60 mesh samples of 0.55 gm copper, 1.0 gm lead, 1.0 gm silver, 0.36 gm antimony, 0.23 gm arsenic, 0.27 gm nickel, 1.70 gm mercury, 0.60 gm bismuth and 0.58 gm gold was shaken for 1 hour at room temperature with 25 gm of CuSO4.5H2 O in 150 ml of acetonitrile, 150 ml of water and 3 ml H2 SO4. The solution was filtered to leave a residue of 5.10 gm. The filtrate contained 0.55 gm extra copper, 0.50 gm silver, 0.18 gm nickel, and 0.024 gm bismuth. Not more than 0.005 gm of lead, antimony, mercury or gold could be detected in the filtrate.\nc. 2-Hydroxycyanoethane - 0.25 gm of minue 60 mesh silver was stirred with 1.0 gm CuSO4.5H2 O, 1 ml of H2 SO4, 10 ml of 2-hydroxycyanoethane and 10 ml of water at 50\u00b0C for 20 minutes, after which time all the silver had dissolved. Addition of copper powder cemented 0.23 gms of silver.\nFurther details of reaction 9 are in Table 9.\nTABLE 9\nRate of oxidation of silver and generation of cuprous sulphate 0.5 gms of minus 60 mesh silver, 2.0 gm\nCuSO4.5H2 O, 2% H2 SO4 v/v, stirred solution.\n\n ______________________________________[CH.sub.3 CN]    [H.sub.2 O]              % Ag.sup.+ dissolvedml       ml        12 hrs at 25\u00b0C                            20 mins 60\u00b0C______________________________________15.0     8.0       60            7612.5     10.5      60            8010.0     13.0      50            557.5      15.5      45            555.0      18.0      18            202.5      20.5       7             70        23.0       1             1______________________________________\n\n Reaction 10. - Cu.sub.2 O + 2H.sup.+ \u2192 2Cu.sup.+ + H.sub.2 O\nExamples\na. Ten gm of cuprous oxide -16 plus 100 mesh, was shaken with a solution of 10 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid, 25 ml of acetonitrile and 65 ml of water at about 50\u00b0C in a sealed vessel for 1 hour. A colourless solution of CuHSO4 was formed. This was filtered and found to contain 8.5 gms Cu+.\nb. The experiment was repeated with 30 ml of 2-hydroxycyanoethane, in place of the 25 ml of acetonitrile and 5 ml of the water, with substantially the same result.\nc. A copper plate was heated in air to produce a film of black cuprous oxide. The plate was cooled and dipped into a composition of 20 ml of 2-hydroxycyanoethane, 70 ml of water and 10 ml of sulphuric acid. The black colour disappeared within 1 minute and a bright copper surface appeared. The solution contained cuprous ions. The plate was washed in a composition of 90 ml of water, 10 ml of 2-hydroxycyanoethane and 1 ml of sulphuric acid, then with water and dried to give a bright copper surface.\nThe dissolution of cuprous oxide was repeated successfully with a number of related compositions containing different proportions of sulphuric acid and acetonitrile, but always consistent with the stoichiometry of reaction 10, with a homogeneous composition, and with at least 3 moles of acetonitrile per mole of Cu+ dissolved.\n\n Reaction 11. - Cu.sub.2 S + 2H.sup.+ \u2192 H.sub.2 S + 2Cu.sup.+\nSamples of materials containing cuprous and sulphide ions were ground to -100 mesh and 0.6 gm portions were placed in the reaction vessel, containing a condenser. The solids were suspended in 15 ml of dry acetonitrile at about 20\u00b0C and 1 ml of oleum was cautiously added with shaking. Hydrogen sulphide was evolved. A further 2 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid was slowly added and the solution was stirred for 1 hour in a very slow stream of cold dry nitrogen to sweep out the hydrogen sulphide. The solution was filtered and diluted with 50 ml of water. Cuprous sulphide was completely leached of its copper by this procedure, but attempts to perform the reaction on a larger scale failed because of polymerisation of the acetonitrile by acid at elevated temperatures and the endothermicity of reaction 11.\n\n Reaction 12. - 3 CuO + 3SO.sub.2 + H.sub.2 O \u2192 CuSO.sub.4 + 2CuHSO.sub.3.\n\n 3 CuCO.sub.3 + 3SO.sub. 2 + H.sub.2 O \u2192 CuSO.sub.4 + 2CuHSO.sub.3 + 3CO.sub.2.\n\n 3 Cu(OH).sub.2 + 3SO.sub.2 + \u2192 CuSO.sub.4 + 2CuHSO.sub.3 + 2H.sub.2 O\nThe reaction is reduction of cupric to cuprous ions by SO2 in nitrile-water mixtures as in reaction 7, but is presented as a separate reaction because the basic copper salt also acts to remove excess acid produced by reduction and thus allows reduction to proceed to completion. The reaction proceeded readily at normal temperature and pressure of SO2 to give cuprous salts. These were thermally disproportionated, with the modification that the residue, following slow disproportionation, was washed with sulphuric acid to convert any precipitated red CuSO3 to copper and cupric sulphate.\nExamples of reaction 12 and thermal disproportionation of the solution.\na. When 2.5 g CuO was stirred for one-half hour at 25\u00b0C with 50 mls water saturated with SO2 the black oxide dissolved and precipitated in its place red cuprous sulphite. Thus the reaction did not remove copper from other solids. The yield was 2.1 gms (95%). On washing this precipitate with 1N H2 SO4, SO2 was evolved and copper remained (0.6 g).\nb. When 2.5 g CuO was stirred for one-half hour at 25\u00b0C with 40 mls of water, saturated with SO2 and 15 mls of acetonitrile, the oxide dissolved to give a clear light green solution which could be separated from insolubles. This solution was thermally disproportionated to remove SO2 and CH3 CN. Copper was deposited in a yield of 0.95 g (quantitative). In the presence of acetonitrile, cuprous sulphite reacts to form the soluble cuprous bisulphite and the CuSO4, from the initial reaction, reacts further according to reaction 7 above.\nThe overall reaction of leaching and disproportionation is thought to be\n\n 2CuO + SO.sub.2 \u2192 Cu + CuSO.sub.4.\nWhen the distillation step is carried out quickly, thermal disproportionation does not go to completion and a mixture of copper plus cuprous sulphite is precipitated. Washing with N H2 SO4 liberates SO2 from Cu2 SO3 and leaves copper in a lower yield with generation of some cupric sulphate.\nc. When procedure (b) was repeated with a mixture of CuCO3 + CU(OH)2 in place of cupric oxide a similar good yield of copper was achieved.\n\n Reaction 13. - Cu + Ag.sup.+ \u2192 Cu.sup.+ + Ag\nOne hundred mls of a solution of silver sulphate in water containing 1N sulphuric acid 25% by volume acetonitrile and assaying about 5% by weight Ag+ was shaken in a sealed reaction vessel at room temperature with 3.5 grams of copper powder. Solid silver was precipitated within five minutes and the solution remained colourless. The solid was filtered off. The filtrate contained about 3% by weight copper as cuprous ions and no detectable silver. It was stored in a sealed vessel. The solid silver, containing some copper was shaken for ten minutes with 50 ml of a solution of cupric sulphate in sulphuric acid, acidified water containing 20% by volume acetonitrile and assaying about 4% cupric ion by weight, then separated by filtration, washed with water and dried. The recovered silver was 5 gms and it contained <20 ppm copper.\nThe experiment was repeated using silver nitrate in place of silver sulphate and 0.1 Molar nitric acid in place of sulphuric acid, with essentially the same recovery of purified silver.\nThermal Disproportion of Solutions of Cuprous Salts.\nSolutions of cuprous sulphate (with CuHSO3 from reactions 7 and 12) in 500 mls of H2 SO4 acidified mixtures of water with acetonitrile were prepared in reaction vessels by reactions 1-13 of FIG. 6, using compositions well within the preferred ranges. The solutions were centrifuged to remove all suspended solids, and about 0.1% by weight gelatin or Avitone (a sodium alkylaryl sulphonate) or ORZAN (an ammonium lignin sulphonate) were added. The solutions were transferred to a precipitation vessel and slowly distilled through an efficient column in a distillation apparatus equipped for magnetic stirring under a slow stream of nitrogen. The solutions darkened in colour to a deep blue and as the first traces of copper powder were deposited in the stirred solutions, about 0.1% by weight of good quality copper powder was added as seed. The distillation was continued slowly until all the nitrilewater azeotrope had been removed. The solid copper was separated from the blue solution by decantation and the copper powder was washed thoroughly, first with the acidified azeotrope then with warm water. The first washings and the distillate were retained. The copper powder was quickly dried. Very little oxidation was observed. Yields were >90% in all cases, based on disproportionation of the available cuprous ion and following distillation beyond the azeotrope to remove all the nitrile.\nThis was the general procedure, but it was modified in various ways. The following data are relevant. The yields quoted as >90% followed virtually complete removal of the acetonitrile, i.e. beyond the azeotrope.\nEffect of Pressure. - It is an advantage to minimise hydrolysis of acetonitrile which was fast in 10% H2 SO4 at 100\u00b0C, so that distillation at 50\u00b0-60\u00b0 under reduced pressure may be desirable. Table 10 gives some relevant data.\nTABLE 10\nDistillation of cuprous sulphate in acidified acetonitrile-water mixtures (5% Cu+ by weight, 20% MeCN, 5% H2 SO4 and water)b.\n\n Pressure \u00b1 10 mm B.Pt.

Thus acetonitrile in excess of this proportion could be removed quite rapidly without greatly influencing the thermal disproportionation. The copper recovery was almost a linear function of the volume of nitrile removed once the proportion of acetonitrile to cuprous ion was down to about 2.5:1.\nIn summary, a saturated solution of Cu2 SO4 in 25% by volume of acetonitrile, 0.5% by volume of sulphuric acid and water, gave 70% of the available copper, when about 80% v/v of the available acetonitrile was distilled off as its azeotrope. Further removal of acetonitrile took place at higher temperatures and more copper was deposited, but removal to the point where no more azeotrope can be removed was preferred, since in most of the applications of thermal disproportionation, the cuprous ion which is not disproportionated is recycled and because high temperatures should be avoided because of hydrolysis of the nitrile.\nEffect of Acid. - Sulphuric acid was preferred for thermal disproportionation since acids like nitric acid oxidise copper and cuprous ions, when present at more than 0.2 molar. The amount of acid chosen, also depends on impurities in the cuprous solution. Thus copper, which was more free of arsenic, iron, antimony, and bismuth, was obtained when thermal disproportionation was from solutions >2% in sulphuric acid by volume, than from solutions <1% H2 SO4 by volume. Copper arsenates were formed if the acidity decreased in solutions containing copper and arsenic. In general, solutions containing 1-2% by volume sulphuric acid were thermally disproportionated, but this depends on impurities.\nEfficiency of the distillation. - An efficient column was essential. With only a still head, the temperature of the distillate rose quite rapidly to 90\u00b0C and it consequently contained a smaller proportion of acetonitrile, when a Cu2 SO4, CH3 CN, H2 SO4, H2 O composition was thermally disproportionated.\nQuality of the copper. - The copper produced was usually a course \"sandy\" powder, although plates were formed sometimes at the gas-liquid interface. It was easy to wash and did not appear to oxidise very readily. The presence of copper seeds just prior to disproportionation gave an improved fine discrete powder. Other additives (about 0.1% by weight) had a pronounced effect on the quality of the powder. Thus thiourea, manganous sulphate, and ferrous sulphate gave coagulated deposits, sodium thiosulphate gave a coarse powder, and gelatin, ORZAN (ammonium lignin sulphonate) and AVITONE (sodium alkylaryl sulphonates) i.e. commercial \"copper\" refining additives, gave excellent quality, discrete powders of high purity.\nPurity of Copper. - Cuprous solutions in acetonitrile-water mixtures were prepared by reaction 1 using AR copper sulphate. They contained a variety of other salts in solution and were thermally disproportionated by the general method to give copper powder which was very much purer than the starting material containing copper. Analyses are in Table 1. Most of the other salts remained in solution. Contamination was most serious with arsenic, antimony, silver, tin, and iron, but more As, Sb and Fe but less silver remained effectively in solution if disproportionation was from solutions containing more than 2% by volume H2 SO4.\nSolution of cuprous sulphate, 3% Cu+ by weight, 1.5% H2 SO4 by volume, 30% acetonitrile and 68.5% water by volume were contaminated by adding the impurities shown. The solutions were filtered and thermally disproportionated by the general procedure. The precipitated copper was analysed to give the results shown in Table 11.\nSilver in the cuprous solution was removed prior to disproportionation by cementing with copper. Tin dissolved apparently as stannous salts and was apparently oxidised during disproportionation to insoluble stannic salts, because a white solid containing tin precipitated with the copper. A second dissolution of this contaminated copper by reaction 1 and thermal disproportionation gave copper with considerably less tin in it. If solutions containing stannous salts were refluxed with cupric sulphate a white solid containing tin was formed. This was filtered off prior to disproportionation to give copper which was substantially free of tin.\nTABLE 11\n\n Additive     ppm of Cu.sup..sup.+d                      ppm Cu.sup.c,e______________________________________FeSO.sub.4    600,000       120NiSO.sub.4    600,000       140Sb.sub.2 O.sub.3          6,000        360AgNO.sub.3.sup.a          60,000.sup.a  8PbNO.sub.3     60,000.sup.b  12______________________________________ .sup.a The solution was treated with copper powder to cement silver befor thermal disproportionation. .sup.b Lead sulphate was filtered off. .sup.c By analysis of copper after thermal disproportionation. .sup.d Parts of the metal additive per million parts of copper detected in the solution, following addition of the salt. .sup.e Parts of the metal additive per million parts of copper, detected in the copper produced by thermal disproportionation.\nEffect of Cuprous salts. - Thermal disproportionation of Cu2 SO4 or CuHSO4 was most common and proceeded as described. Solutions of cuprous nitrate containing 0.75% of nitric acid and prepared by treating 4 gm of copper powder with 10 gm of cupric nitrate in 150 ml of 30% v/v acetonitrile-water under the conditions of reaction 1 gave 2.9 gms of copper when thermally disproportionated. Some dissolution of copper powder by nitric acid in reaction 1 accounts for the 110% yield.\n500 ml of solutions of cuprous bisulphite, containing sulphurous acid and prepared by reaction 12 in 25% acetonitrile-water mixtures and assaying 2-4% cuprous ion, were very slowly thermally disproportionated until 200 ml had been distilled. A little Cu2 SO3 was precipitated as well as copper, but upon washing with 1 Normal aqueous H2 SO4 this was disproportionated to copper and cupric sulphate. The yield of copper was >85% based on the cuprous ion disproportoination.\nEffect of Nitriles. - A composition of 25% acetonitrile containing 20% by volume acrylonitrile, water, 2% sulphuric acid and cuprous sulphate containing 4% Cu+, by weight was thermally disproportionated. The yield of copper was 22 90% based on disproportionation of Cu+. In another experiment, 10 gm of atomised blister copper (-100 mesh) was stirred with 35 g of CuSO4.5H2 O in 500 ml of solution containing 30% acrylonitrile, 30% ethanol, 35% water and 5% H2 SO4 all on a volume basis. The colour was discharged after 1 hour, the solution was filtered and thermally disproportionated to to remove acrylonitrile at 69\u00b0-71\u00b0C. Nine gm of copper was precipitated containing 30 ppm lead, 14 ppm silver, <30 ppm selenium and <1 ppm nickel. The blister copper contained 10 times this level of impurities before treatment.\nEffect of oxygen. - Air was bubbled through a solution initially of 10% by weight Cu2 SO4 in acidified 25% acetonitrile-water during thermal disporportionation. The yield of copper was reduced to 30%, based on disproportionation of Cu+.\nEffect of Cupric Sulphate. - Solutions which were high in acetonitrile (e.g. 50% by volume) and cuprous sulphate (e.g. 14% Cu+ by weight) sometimes precipitated cupric sulphate with the copper after thermal disproportionation and cooling. In such cases, the solids were washed with hot water to remove cupric sulphate.\nA number of copper powder refining and cuprous winning experiments on 500 ml solutions of about 10% Cu2 SO4 by weight, 20-25% acetonitrile; water and 1-2% H2 SO4 by volume are summarized below.\nCopper Powder Refining. - The general procedure for thermal disproportionation of a solution prepared by reaction 1 was followed in a precipitation vessel and then the solution, following removal of the acetonitrile-water azeotrope, was removed to a reaction vessel with a peristaltic pump and recombined with the azeotrope, maintaining a sealed system at 50\u00b0-60\u00b0C under nitrogen. The acidity was checked and a little H2 SO4 was added to return it to 0.5 Normal. This solution was mixed with an excess (30 gms) of finely divided (-16 plus 100 mesh) blister copper as specified for reaction 1 and the resulting cuprous sulphate solution was filtered from the reaction vessel. About 1 mg of glue was added, and the thermal disproportionation was repeated in the precipitation vessel containing the previous copper powder. The cycle was repeated three times with no significant change in the yield or purity of the resulting copper powder. The equipment used was arranged in a way based on part of FIG. 5, using a peristaltic pump to transfer solutions from reaction vessel to precipitation vessel.\nCuprous winning. - The general procedure for thermal disproportionation was followed on solutions of known Cu+ concentration. The solution, following removal of the acetonitrile-water azeotrope, was removed from the precipitation vessel and recombined with one half of the azeotrope in a reaction vessel, maintaining a sealed system under nitrogen. This solution was treated with about 7 gms (i.e. 0.25 mole of iron powder per mole of Cu+ in the original solution) in the reaction vessel under the conditions of reaction 8. The resulting cuprous plus ferrous sulphate solution was filtered, acid was added to maintain >1N acid and the solution was thermally disproportionated in the precipitation vessel containing the original precipitated copper. The cycle was repeated, this time with 3.5 gms (i.e. 0.13 mole of iron powder per mole of Cu+ in the original solution) using the same reaction vessel for reaction 8 and the same precipitation vessel for thermal disproportionation. About 80% of the available copper was recovered in this way.\nElectrochemical Disproportionation of Solutions of Cuprous Salts. - Solutions of cuprous sulphate in 500 ml of sulphuric acid, water and acetonitrile or 2-hydroxycyanoethane were prepared by reactions 1-13 using compositions well within the specified ranges and containing 2-5% by weight cuprous ion. The solutions were centrifuged to remove suspended solids and if necessary, the concentration of sulphuric acid was increased to 1.5-3 Normal. About 0.001% by weight of gelatin was added to those solutions in which cathode quality was examined. These almost colourless solutions were placed in a rectangular glass vessel equipped with 4 \u00d7 4 inch copper cathodes between 4 \u00d7 4 inch inert anodes of platinum, dense graphite, graphite cloth or graphite felt at a separation of 1 inch. The solutions were stirred by circulation with a peristaltic pump and the cell was covered with a film of Glad Wrap plastic sheet under which nitrogen was very slowly circulated. The solutions were electrolysed at a current density of 5-40 amps/sq. foot and copper was deposited at the cathode. No gases were evolved at the anode. The temperature varied between 20\u00b0-60\u00b0C.\nThe solutions gradually darkened in their blue colour, the voltage rose and the efficiency calculated on the basis of a one electron process, dropped slowly from 98% to about 50%. The process was not continued beyond 20% recovery of the copper available by disproportionation.\nCopper Powder Electrorefining. - The experiment was performed as described above, except that the peristaltic pump was used to circulate the anolyte through a sealed reaction vessel in which the anolyte was stirred with an excess of -16 + 100 mesh of materials containing >90% copper, such as atomised blister copper, or copper powder from thermal disproportionation. Further traces of glue were added from time to time if cathode quality was being tested. The circulation and current density were adjusted such that the electrolyte emerging from the reaction vessel was very pale blue and it was passed through a glass wool filter before returning to the cell. If the copper was too fine it tended to carry over into the cell, e.g. cement copper. The process was continued for periods of up to four days and good quality, dense, very fine grained copper cathodes were obtained with efficiencies >90%. Some of these were analysed with the results shown in Table 1, i.e. marked purification of copper, relative to the copper feed.\nCuprous electrowinning. - The electrochemical disproportionation was performed in the general way described, and as for copper powder electrorefining except that the peristaltic pump circulated the anolyte through a sealed reaction vessel containing a stirred quantity of iron powder which was 10-20% by weight of the total cuprous ion in the electrolyte. The iron immediately cemented copper from the cuprous solution and this acted as the reductant for the cupric ion in the anolyte. When the cemented copper powder in the reaction vessel had decreased to about 10% of the original volume, a further quantity of iron powder was added, such that it was 10-20% by weight of the cuprous ion in the electrolyte at that stage of the process. These steps were repeated until the quantity of cuprous ion in the electrolyte was so low (e.g. 0.5% at 20 amps/sq. ft) as to lead to gas evolution and rises in voltage at the current density and stirring speed of operation. Good quality cathodes were obtained at efficiencies >85% based on a one electron process. The cathodes contained <10 ppm iron and were at least an order of magnitude lower in impurities than the material used to prepare the cuprous solutions as shown partly in Table 1.\nThe above descriptions describe our preferred general procedure for electrochemical disproportionation, copper powder electrorefining and cuprous electrowinning. The following Tables summarise some of the data showing the effect of different variables on cell voltage, on efficiency and in some cases on cathode quality. For some of the experiments, copper powder electrorefining was performed using deep beakers with the electrodes immersed in them to a shallow depth, with copper of about -16 mesh well stirred at the bottom of the beaker. There were no additives. Although most of the data are for copper powder electrorefining it was found that the effect of different variables was similar for the other forms of electrochemical disproportionation, when tested. It was difficult to reproduce efficiency of stirring, so that not all the results are consistant, except within each set of experiments.\nEffect of Temperature. - The cell voltage increased from about 500 mv to above 800 mv as the temperature was lowered from 45\u00b0 to 20\u00b0C. The electrolyte was 200 ml of cuprous sulphate assaying 4% Cu+, in 25% v/v acetonitrile, 5% v/v H2 SO4, and water. The anode was platinum, the current density was 45 amps/sq. ft. on 10 cm2 electrodes in Glad Wrap-covered, well stirred solutions under nitrogen. The cathodic deposit was always noticeably denser and smoother than 20\u00b0C than at 50\u00b0C. An operating temperature of 30\u00b0-40\u00b0C was chosen as the most desirable.\nEffect of Acid. - As expected, voltages increased as the proportion of sulphuric acid decreased from 7% by volume. Solutions containing 10% H2 SO4 evolved a little gas at the cathode and the quality of the cathode deteriorated as the acid concentration increased.\nEffect of Nitrile Concentration. - The effect of varying the concentration of acetonitrile on the voltage of a copper powder electrorefining experiment at 33\u00b0C, using the composition and conditions specified for temperature variation, but varying the concentration of acetonitrile, is shown in Table 12. Two factors are important, the resistance of the electrolyte, which increases with increasing proportion of nitrile and the ease of disproportionation, which increases with a lower proportion of nitrile to Cu+.\nThe cathode quality the voltage and the efficiency increased with increasing proportion of nitrile. The solutions remained blue, when the proportion of acetonitrile was <3 moles:1 of Cu+. The efficiency for low proportions of acetonitrile was <90%. Electrochemical disproportionation proceeded at very low voltages when the proportion of nitrile to Cu+ was about 3:1, but copper powder electrorefining was not completely satisfactory, we think because of slow reaction 1 and relatively fast oxidation. Thus about 6 moles:1 was preferred.\nEffect of oxygen and evaporation. - A copper powder electrorefining experiment, using the conditions and electrolyte specified for effect of temperature, was performed in an open cell. It operated satisfactorily for 8 hours, but then the voltage rose and the efficiency dropped to 50%. The acidity was markedly less than the initial value.\nEffect of current density. - In a well stirred solution, 500 ml of cuprous sulphate assaying 3% Cu+ by weight, 5% H2 SO4 by volume, water, and 15% by volume acetonitrile at 23\u00b0\u00b12\u00b0C electrolysed with 1 inch between a 20 cm2 platinum anode and copper cathode with no additives gave voltages at the current densities shown in Table 13. The cathodic deposit deteriorated as the current density increased, but the deposit was still adherent at 40 amps/sq. ft.\nEffect of Ferrous sulphate. - The electrolyte described immediately above was contaminated with 25 gm of ferrous sulphate (5%) and electrolysed as described at a current density of 20 amps/sq. ft. The cathode was of similar quality, the efficiency was 91-93% and the voltage was only marginally higher than in the absence of ferrous sulphate. The cathode contained 10 ppm of iron.\nTABLE 12\nEffect of nitrile proportion on cell voltage in Electrochemical Disproportionation at 20\u00b0-22\u00b0C in stirred solutions, dense graphite anote, copper cathode separated by 1 inch.\nElectrolyte: 3% Cu+ by weight, 5% H2 SO4 v/v, water and either 15% (6 moles:1 Cu+) or 25% (10 moles:1 Cu+)\n\n acetonitrile by volumecurrentdensity        25% MeCN.sup.a                     15% MeCNamps/sq ft.

The voltages are shown in Tables 13 and 15. In another experiment, an electrolyte of 3% Cu+, 28% v/v MeCN, 5% H2 SO4 and water was electrolysed at 42\u00b0 and 15 amps/sq. ft. with various anodes of equal areas and a copper cathode in well stirred solutions. The voltages were: stainless steel, 0.95 volt; gold plated steel, 0.85 volt; platinum, 0.65 volt; dense graphite, 0.78 volt. Even lower voltages than those shown in Table 13 were obtained with more vigorously stirred solutions in beakers.\nUse of 2-hydroxycyanoethane. - Two liters of an electrolyte containing 3% weight Cu+, 19% 2-hydroxycyanoethane by volume, 5% H2 SO4 by volume and water, plus about 0.1% by weight of glue, thiourea and AVITONE, was electrolysed at 30\u00b0C with a copper cathode between a platinum and a dense graphite anode respectively at a separation of 1inch. The anode and cathode areas were 12 sq. ins. The solution was stirred by a peristaltic pump which passed the electrolyte through a tower containing copper powder. The current density was 9 amps/sq. ft. The cell operated at 0.60 volts for 12 hours at >95% efficiency for deposition of copper by a one electron process. The cell was covered with Glad Wrap and operated under nitrogen. The cathode deposit was dense and fine grained and contained <10 ppm of Fe, Ni, Pb, or Sn.\nUse of Acetonitrile. - One liter of an electrolyte containing 4% by weight of Cu+, 20% by volume acetonitrile, 5% H2 SO4 by volume, water, and 0.1% of glue, prepared from blister copper and cupric sulphate by reaction (1), was electrolysed at 25\u00b0C with a copper cathode between two dense graphite anodes each 40 cm2, separated by 4 cm at a current density of 15.5 amps/sq. ft. The anolyte was circulated over 15 gm of -16 mesh blister copper in a reaction vessel with stirring, and returned to the cell. The cell was covered with Glad Wrap and was under nitrogen. The cell operated with 0.70 volts over 6 hours with an efficiency of 95% for copper deposited by a one electron process. The cathode was dense and fine grained and contained <10 ppm of Fe, Ni, Pb or Sn.\nTABLE 13\nEffect of Different Anodes and Stirring on Cell Voltage in Electrochemical Disproportionation at 20\u00b0-22\u00b0C.\nElectrolyte: 3% Cu+ by weight, 5% H2 SO4 v/v, 15% MeCN and water.\nElectrodes 20 cm2 separated by 1 inch, copper cathode.\n\n __________________________________________________________________________Cell Voltage (volts).Anodescur-rent    dense    carbon           stainlessdensity    carbon   felt     platinum                         steelamps/sq ft.

No. 283,955, filed Aug. 28, 1972.\nThe present invention relates to a method for producing material for printed circuits, said material comprising a thin layer of metal on an insulating carrier or base.\nPrinted circuits are used to a large extent in the electronics industry and are usually produced with a copperclad plastic laminate as a starting material. A copy of the desired wiring pattern is transferred to the copper layer by printing or by a photochemical method to which is applied so-called etch resist which acts as a protection during subsequent elimination by etching of the superfluous copper. Thereafter electronic components are mounted on the laminate carrying the circuit thus obtained. The copper of the board constitutes the electrical connections and the laminate provides the required mechanical support. This technique provides space and weight saving in the building of an electronic unit. This method of forming a circuit board produces a highly reliable product which is susceptible to mass production techniques.\nThe most common bases are paper-reinforced phenolic laminates which are used for comparatively simple circuits, and glass cloth reinforced epoxy resin laminates which are used where the technical requirements are high. Use is also made of fiber reinforced plastic laminates of other types. Base materials of plastic films and plastic coated metal plates also are used to a certain extent. For producing the copper coating or layer it is common to use copper foils or sheets which are placed on a base-forming fiber material impregnated with partially cured or hardened plastic (so called prepreg) whereupon the composite material is molded at high pressure and increased temperature. The final curing of the plastic is thereafter effected whereby the fiber material is converted into a sheet bonded to the copper foil. The copper foil usually has a thickness of 35 \u03bcm, but thicker and thinner foils also can be used. According to another known method the copper foil is glued to a plastic film by means of heat and pressure.\nOwing to the rapid development of the electronics field the demand for printed circuits with good dimensional precision, especially in circuitry with narrow width lines and short distances between conductors, is increasing. Already at present printed circuits with a line width of 0.2 mm are required in many cases. Even smaller dimensions have been used and such a need will increase in the future. This development has led to a demand for laminates with thinner copper layers. Lately laminates with 17 \u03bcm thick copper foils have come into use to an increasing extent. By using thinner copper foils advantages are gained, i.a. a decrease of the so-called \"undercut.\" By undercut is meant the elimination of copper under the etch resist caused by the etching solution which while dissolving the unprotected portions of the copper layer also eats into the copper covered by the etch resist. The undercut is a difficult problem causing unacceptably low dimensional accuracy especially in circuits with fine-line conductors. The effect of the undercut at varying thicknesses of the copper layer shall be explained in more detail in the following description.\nBy means of suitable technique it is possible to obtain a high degree of precision in the application of the etch resist proper. However, owing to the undercut, difficulties arise in maintaining good dimensional accuracy as to, for instance, the line width which the technique involving masking by means of an etch resist makes possible.\nSome applications require very exactly defined distances between conductors even though being otherwise ordinary-dimensioned circuits. This is particularly true where electrical influence between conductors must be considered, i.a. in electronic systems which operate at high frequencies.\nThin copper-layer clad laminates can be used with advantage also for such systems.\nThere are other advantages as a result of thinner copper layers. Thus, the etching time is considerably reduced and the amount of etching solution consumed also is reduced. The amount of copper required for obtaining the copper layer is likewise reduced. Because of these advantages thin copper layers can be beneficial also if the requirements as to dimensional accuracy are not very high.\nIf an increased thickness of the copper conductor is desirable the thickness can be increased by chemically or electrolytically depositing copper according to known techniques. By either procedure copper is deposited only on the portion of the copper layer constituting the conductors of the final printed circuit which portion usually is the minor portion of the total surface of the printed circuit. By suitable techniques the increase of the thickness of the copper layers can be effected with good dimensional accuracy. In the case of insulation bases which are provided on both sides thereof with a conductor pattern of copper the increase of the copper thickness can suitably be carried out in connection with a so-called through-holes plating which is a method often used for providing electrical connections between the printed circuits on each side of the base and for providing holes for the mounting of electrical components. Thus, no extra process step is required to increase the thickness of the conductors. The method also provides the advantage that the main portion of the conductors of the circuit and the copper layer in the holes will consist of homogeneous and simultaneously deposited metal which is favorable from the point of view of reliability.\nFrom the above discussion the advantages gained by using bases with thinner metal layers than what is used at present in the manufacture of printed circuits clearly appear.\nIn the usual method for the production of metal coated, insulating bases for printed circuits an unbroken or continuous, non-patterned metal foil or sheet is used as a starting material which foil is bonded to the base by molding at increased temperature or in other ways. The most commonly used metal foil is a copper foil produced electrolytically. Such a copper foil has a high degree of purity. However, numerous problems occur if an insulating base with a copper foil having a thickness less than 17 \u03bcm shall be produced according to the usual method, since there are many difficulties in connection with the practical handling of such thin copper foils. Another sizeable disadvantage of this known method in the case of very thin copper foils produced electrolytically is due to the fact that the copper foil often has cavities and through-going holes, so call micropores, the latter being, for reasons easily realized, more difficult to avoid with a decreased thickness of the foil. During the molding of the laminate still uncured resin material can penetrate through the pores and accumulate on the free surface of the foil where it can give rise to difficulties i.a. during the subsequent etching of the copper foil when the resin on the surface acts as an unwanted etch-resist.\nAnother method has been suggested according to which a thin copper layer is deposited on an insulating base by directly plating on the base. Such plating must be effected at least partly by methods other than electroplating since the carrier is of an insulating material. An applicable method is chemical plating which, however, is comparatively expensive and complicated. Thus, for instance, the surface of the laminate must often be pretreated to assure good bonding of the deposited copper. This pretreatment can give rise to deep cavities in the base which cavities will be filled by copper during the plating procedure. This necessitates relatively long etching time to assure that all copper is removed from the etched portions of the laminate. The prolonged etching time increases the production costs and also leads to an increased undercut even in the case of laminates with thin chemically deposited copper layers.\nFor completing the picture of the prior art in the manufacture of materials for printed circuits a method shall be mentioned which is described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,692,190. According to this patent a final wiring pattern of copper is applied to or formed on a temporary base whereupon this base with the pattern facing the final, insulating base, and with the resin material of the final base still uncured is molded to the final base. In the molding operation the wiring pattern usually penetrates the final base. After final curing or hardening the temporary base is removed, for instance by etching. This method has been described in connection with ordinary thicknesses for the copper layer and often has the purpose of providing a final printed circuit in which the surface of the wiring pattern is situated at the same level as the surrounding surface of the insulating base. This makes it possible to use so-called glide contacts in the circuit arrangement for which the circuit is to be used. However, it turns out that this known method has certain inconveniences which can cause trouble at least in certain applications. Some of these inconveniences are discussed in British Pat. No. 1,116,299. In connection with the present invention it shall be further pointed out that practical and economic difficulties arise when the method is used for the production of printed circuits requiring a very high degree of precision, i.a., in the manufacture of circuits with very narrow wiring pattern conductors and very short distances between the conductors. After the etching the temporary base with the wiring must be handled, transported and molded to the final insulating base. These steps combine to decrease the accuracy of the method. It also is to be understood that the method is practically unusuable for laminates with wiring patterns on each side of the final base and with so-called through-holes plating. Finally it should be recognized that an increase in the thickness of the copper conductors on the final base meets with great difficulty if a high degree of accuracy is desired.\nThe inconveniences of the known methods pointed out above are avoided to a very high degree by the present invention.\nThe method according to the present invention for the production of material having a layer of metal on an insulating base for printed circuits comprises applying by electroplating a thin, unbroken unpatterned metal layer having a thickness less than 17 \u03bcm to a temporary base, having a thickness of for instance about 30 \u03bcm preferably of a throw-away type, in the form of a metal foil aluminum, zinc, their alloys, steel, or a thin layer of metal on aluminum which is more electro-positive than zinc, strongly adhering the free surface of the said thin metal layer to a final, insulating base and removing the temporary base whereupon desired wiring patterns of printed circuits can be produced by a process comprising etching of metal layer bound to the final insulating base.\nThe thickness of the thin metal layer, should according to the present invention be between 1 and 15 \u03bcm, preferably between 2 and 10 \u03bcm, and can be, for instance about 5 \u03bcm.\nAccording to the present invention it is not necessary to carry out the steps of the method immediately one after the other and in one and the same locality. The procedure can be divided in time and space by separately producing one or more intermediate products which are thereafter subjected to complementary treatment for carrying out the complete method according to the present invention.\nThe thin metal layer which is to form the wiring pattern can suitably consist of copper or nickel or their alloys. The metal layer can be a single layer or consist of a combination of two or more layers of different metals or alloys thereof. Other metals than those mentioned above and other combinations of metals also can be used.\nThe final, insulating base can suitably consist of a stiff sheet of plastic which may be fiber-reinforced, for instance a sheet of glass fiber reinforced epoxy resin, but it also can consist of a plastic film which may likewise be fiber-reinforced.\nAccording to a further development of the present invention for application especially in the case when a foil of aluminum or an alloy thereof is used as a temporary base a relatively thin layer of zinc, tin or their alloys can be applied on the surface of the temporary base facing the metal layer, before applying the metal layer by electroplating.\nThe present invention also relates to a material for printed circuits produced by the method according to the present invention and to materials intended to be used in the form of intermediate products for carrying out the method. A first intermediate product consists of a temporary base of throw-away type in the form of a foil aluminum, zinc, their alloys, steel, a foil of aluminum upon which has been placed a layer of zinc or a layer of zinc on the temporary base being replaced electrochemically wholly or partly by a layer of a metal which is more electro-positive than the metal zinc, with at least one unbroken or continuous, thin layer of metal applied by electroplating. The layer has a thickness less than 17 \u03bcm, suitably a thickness of 1 - 15 \u03bcm, and preferably a thickness of 2 - 10 \u03bcm. A second intermediate product consists of the first intermediate product laminated or molded to the final insulating base with the thin metal layer facing the final base and bound thereto. The electroplating of the metal layer onto the temporary base may be accomplished by depositing the copper electrolytically from a copper cyanide solution or an acid copper solution, normally a sulphate copper solution.\nHowever, when the copper is deposited electrolytically on the zinc-treated aluminum foil from, for instance, a copper cyanide solution or an acid copper solution, normally a sulphate copper solution, certain drawbacks result. One drawback with the solution containing cyanide is its poisonousness. It is here not only a question of environmental aspects and the costs for taking care of an neutralizing used plating solution, but also of the disadvantages and risks associated with the fairly large amount of poison which has to be handled at the working sites.\nThe difficulties are considerably reduced, if copper cyanide solution is avoided and the plating is performed in an acid copper solution directly on the zinc coated aluminum foil. However, this generally results in a very low adhesion between the copper layer and the zinc layer, and it is difficult to avoid blistering between the two layers at the subsequent processing steps.\nTherefore, one of the objects of the present invention is to avoid the aforesaid disadvantages and to provide a material for printed circuits and a method for its production, which satisfies prevailing requirements as to the properties of the material and the influence on the environment.\nAccording to the present invention a method for the production of a material for printed circuits has been devised in which a thin layer of zinc is first applied to the temporary base, the layer of zinc being then replaced electrochemically, wholly or partly, by a layer of a metal which is more electro-postive than the metal zinc, whereupon the copper layer is applied on the layer of said more inert metal by means of plating.\nThe material thus obtained may then be strongly bonded to a final insulating base with the copper layer facing said final insulating base, which may be, for instance, a plastic laminate. The laminate with the copper layer and the temporary base can then be used at any desired site for the production of printed circuits. For such production the temporary base in the form of an aluminum foil is first removed, for instance by etching, whereafter the desired wiring pattern is obtained by a method comprising etching on the copper layer bonded to the final base which copper after the temporary base has been removed may still be covered by a coating of said metal which is more electro-positive than zinc.\nAccording to the present invention the layer of zinc on the temporary base is preferably replaced by nickel. The metal more electro-positive than zinc and moreover capable of being plated in an acid copper solution, is not limited to nickel since other metals such as, for instance, iron, chrome, tin, cadmium and cobalt may be chosen. The average thickness of the layer of nickel thus obtained is suitably at least 0.01 \u03bcm but not more than 1 \u03bcm, for example 0.05 to 0.5 \u03bcm. The replacement of zinc by nickel can suitably be carried out in a solution in which the Ni++-concentration is 2 to 25 g/l (grams per liter), preferably 5 to 15 g/l, e.g., about 8 g/l. Nickel chloride has proved to be a suitable supplier of nickel ions in the solution, the pH value of which generally ought to be between 0.5 to 5, preferably between 1 and 3.\nThe plating of copper on the layer of nickel may be performed in an acid copper solution.\nWith regard to the removal of the temporary base from the copper layer the possibility of removing the temporary base by hand or with the aid of mechanical means has several practical advantages for many applications. When the temporary base is peeled off this can be performed rapidly and easy and it does not cause any appreciable problems with waste products, which by contrast, is the case if the temporary base is removed for instance by etching. The water products produced when the temporary base is etched are solutions of aluminum salts and hydrogen gas, which require special protective measures. For the production of copper-coated foils of aluminum by plating first in a copper cyanide solution and then in a strongly acid (sulfuric acid) copper solution an adhesion between the foil of aluminum and copper is obtained, which is so adjusted that the foil of aluminum can be peeled off. The use of a copper cyanide solution, however, creates special problems regarding toxicity.\nAt the same time as it is desirable to be able to peel off the foil of aluminum, which necessitates a relatively low degree of adhesion between aluminum and copper, a certain degree of adhesion between the two metal layers is required to prevent unintentional separation of said layers from each other at the handling of the product. Consequently the degree of adhesion between aluminum and copper must lie between two limits. The upper limit is determined by the requirement that it must be possible to peel off the foil of aluminum without the layer of copper or parts of it being separated from the final base, and this peeling off should preferably be possible to perform by hand from larger surfaces without too much effort. The lower limit is determined by the requirement that it must be possible to handle the copper coated foil of aluminum at various stages of the production process without the two metal layers becoming separated from each other. Another factor which necessitates a certain minimum adhesion between aluminum and copper is connected with the presence of small through-going holes, so called mircopores, in the plated copper layer. These micropores which in practice are difficult completely to avoid, lead to risks for small resin patches being formed on the surface at the production by high pressure molding of, for instance, glass fiber reinforced plastic epoxy laminate. This is due to the fact that during the molding, which occurs at an elevated temperature, the resin passes a state of relatively low viscosity before it is hardened and is transformed into the solid state. In its fluid state some of the resin may be pressed through the micropores to form small patches on the surface of the copper. These resin patches cause difficulties at the production of circuits for instance by etching. This problem is avoided if the adhesion between aluminum and copper is so high that the foil of aluminum forms a barrier which prevents the resin from penetrating to the surface of the copper layer. As the aluminum foil during the molding operation is pressed against the one surface of the copper layer with the same force as the resin is pressed in the opposite direction, the adhesion between aluminum and copper, it is true, needs not amount to a very high value, but on the other hand it must not be so low that the resin during the molding operation can penetrate between the copper layer and the aluminum foil at those points where the adhesion between them is particularly weak.\nTherefore another object of the present invention is to provide a method for plating a foil of aluminum or an aluminum alloy with a layer of copper for production of a material for printed circuits which secures such an adhesion between the copper layer and the foil of aluminum that the above mentioned requirements are fulfilled.\nThe method according to the present invention is characterized in principle in that the plating is performed in a solution containing copper, pyrophosphate, and an acid, the pK value of which is at least 0.8 at 20\u00b0C.\nAccording to the present invention the pH value of the plating solution is adjusted to between 3.5 and 9, preferably to between 5 and 8, by means of, e.g., ammonium hydroxide or an amine.\nThe content of copper in the plating solution expressed as metal should be 5 to 50 g/l, preferably 10 to 30 g/l, and the content of pyrophosphate calculated as the content of the pyrophosphate group (P2 O7) should be 5 to 400 g/l, preferably 25 to 250 g/l, e.g., about 70 g/l. At the plating the current density can be between 2 and 35 A/dm2, preferably between 5 and 20 A/dm2, and the temperature of the solution can be 30\u00b0 to 100\u00b0C.\nThe acid in the solution can suitably be oxalic acid or a similar organic or inorganic, weak acid.\nA measuring method, which suitably can be used for determining the degree of adhesion between a base and a layer adhering to it, for instance a foil, and which is frequently used in practice for copper-clad laminates designed for printed circuits, is ASTM D-1867. According to this method the strength is measured which is required for peeling off a strip of foil perpendicularly to the base.\nThe adhesion as measured according to this method is to a certain extent dependent on the thickness and the rigidity of the foil. Practical experiments have shown that when the adhesion of a rolled 50 \u03bcm thick aluminum foil to a base is not more than about 0.5 kp/cm as measured according to ASTM D-1867, the foil can easily be peeled off by hand power. When mechanical facilities are used higher values, e.g., up to about 1.0 kp/cm, can be allowed. If the base as in the present invention is a layer of copper which in its turn is bonded to a final base, for instance a laminate, there is no risk that the copper layer will be peeled off from the final base provided that the adhesion between the two last mentioned materials amounts to values generally accepted in practice. For glass web reinforced epoxy plastic laminates to which a foil of copper having a thickness of 35 \u03bcm is bonded, the adhesion between the copper foil and the laminate shall be at least 8 lbs/inch = 1.43 kp/cm, measured according to ASTM D-1867.\nIn practical experiments with a material consisting of an aluminum foil having a thickness of 50 \u03bcm plated with a copper layer, it has, however, turned out that, as the adhesion between the two layers of metal is less than about 0.01-0.02 kp/cm, the metal layers will easily become separated from each other during the handling of the material. In view of the aforesaid it is reasonable to establish that the adhesion between the aluminum foil and the copper layer ought to be within the limits 0.01 and 1.0 kp/cm at measurements performed according to ASTM D-1867 on rolled aluminum foil having a thickness of 50 \u03bcm. Good results are obtained within the limits 0.05 and 0.5 kp/cm. The adhesion should preferably be between 0.05 and 0.3 kp/cm.\nThe effect of the aluminum foil as a barrier against penetration of resin in the production of a laminate by molding can be easily tested by etching away the copper layer from the final base. If during the molding operation resin has penetrated through the micropores and formed small patches on the surface of the copper, residues of copper will remain on the final base after the etching, because the patches of resin have acted as etching masks preventing the copper under the patches from being etched away. Experiments have shown that, even at as low an adhesion as 0.005 kp/cm, no residues of copper remained on the final base after the etching operation. In these experiments the final base consisted of a glass web reinforced epoxy resin laminate. In experiments for comparison in which the copper layer was peeled off from the foil of aluminum before the molding operation small patches having a diameter of about 3 mm were obtained on the surface of the epoxy laminate after etching.\nThe present invention will be more fully described hereinbelow with reference to the drawings. In the drawings,\nFIGS. 1-3 illustrate the influence of the thickness of the copper layer on the so-called undercut in an etching procedure;\nFIGS. 4-10 illustrate steps of a method according to one embodiment of the present invention;\nFIG. 11 illustrates the result of a modified method;\nFIGS. 12-14 illustrate the steps of a method according to the present invention in which the thickness of the wiring pattern forming portions of a thin metal layer are increased by plating, whereupon the other portions of the metal layer are removed by etching;\nFIG. 15 illustrates the result after so-called through-holes plating;\nFIG. 16 shows schematically a device for producing, according to the present invention, materials for printed circuits; and\nFIG. 17 illustrates schematically a further embodiment of the method according to the present invention.\nIn FIGS. 1-3 there is shown in cross-section a metal layer of copper 2I, 2II and 2III respectively, of a printed circuit. The copper layer is bonded to an insulating base 1 and covered by an etch resist 3. In FIG. 1 reference 4 designates the cavity in the metal layer under the etch resist caused by the etching. UI is the measure of the undercut. In FIGS. 2 and 3 the undercut is designated by UII and UIII, respectively. The metal layer 2I according to FIG. 1 is relatively thick, i.e., about 35 \u03bcm, and requires an extensive etching time. The undercut in this case is considerable. The metal layer 2II in FIG. 2 is thinner, i.e., about 17 \u03bcm, and the undercut UII is considerably less than UI of FIG. 1. The metal layer 2III is very thin, for instance about 5 \u03bcm, and requires only a short etching time. The undercut UIII is negligible even when the conductors formed by the metal layer are of a very small width.\nFIGS. 4 - 10 illustrate a method according to the present invention. FIG. 4 illustrates a temporary base 5 of aluminum. In FIG. 5 a thin copper layer 6, with a thickness less than 17 \u03bcm is deposited by electroplating to 5. In FIG. 6 the material according to FIG. 5 is thereafter laminated or molded with a final, insulating base 7, for instance of glass fiber reinforced epoxy resin, with the copper layer facing the final base. The temporary base 5 is removed, for instance by peeling or by etching as shown in FIG. 7. On the product of FIG. 7, an etch resist 8 is then applied which corresponds to a desired pattern as seen in FIG. 8. The uncovered portions of the thin copper layer are removed thereafter by etching as shown in FIG. 9. After dissolving the etch resist 8 the final printed circuit is obtained as in FIG. 10.\nThe material shown in FIG. 7 can, as shown in FIGS. 8 and 9, be used as such, in which case the advantage is obtained that the undercut is negligible. This advantage can, however, be maintained also if it is desired to produce wiring patterns with increased conductor thickness. FIGS. 12 - 14 show how this can be achieved.\nOn an insulating base 11 a copper layer 12 with a thickness of, for instance, 5 \u03bcm has been deposited by means of a method according to the present invention. For increasing the thickness of the conductors a mask 13 corresponding to the negative of the desired conductor pattern is first applied to the copper layer 12, as shown in FIG. 12. Thereafter further copper 16 is deposited on the layer 12 by electroplating until the desired conductor thickness, for instance 35 \u03bcm, has been obtained whereupon a different metal serving as an etch resist 17 is applied to the deposited copper, all as shown in FIG. 13. Finally the mask 13 is dissolved and the thin copper layer covered by the mask is removed by etching which takes only a short time. The result is shown in FIG. 14 from which appears that a conductor with a considerable thickness for instance 35 \u03bcm, and with very accurate dimensions has been achieved, the latter thanks to the absence of mentionable undercut.\nIn FIG. 15 a so-called through-holes plating method is illustrated which suitably can be carried out simultaneously with plating for achieving increased conductor thickness as illustrated in FIGS. 12- 14. An insulated base 21 is provided on each side thereof with a very thin copper layer 22a and 22b respectively, by a method according to the present invention. In the composite material through-going holes 24 have been made, for instance by drilling. After pretreatment of the holes and after masking in a known manner plating is carried out whereby the deposited copper material is applied on the unmasked portions of the thin copper layer and on the inner walls of the holes until the desired plating thickness has been achieved. After removing the mask and etching the underlying portions of the copper layer the final product shown in FIG. 15 is obtained. It appears that the deposited copper layers 23a on the thin copper layers and the deposited copper layers 23b on the walls of the holes 24 become approximately equally thick and have good connection to each other which is of great importance from the point of view of reliability.\nThe temporary base used in the method according to the present invention need and should not be thicker than what is required for forming and supporting the thin copper layer so that the composite material consisting of the temporary base and the copper layer can be handle comfortably during the further processing. The temporary base should preferably be of the throwaway type so that it can be destroyed after use. The thickness of the temporary base depends on the stiffness of the materials used but should suitably be not more than 0.2 mm, preferably not more than 0.1 mm and can be, for instance, about 0.03 mm.\nA further advantage of the present invention is that the temporary base can serve as protection against oxidation, scratching and other damage of the thin metal layer during transport, storing and mechanical treatment of the laminate. The temporary base is then removed in connection with the manufacture of the printed circuit.\nAnother advantage is related to the aforementioned presence of through-going holes, so-called micropores, in the copper layer, said micropores being difficult to avoid in an electroplating process. These micropores create, as mentioned, difficulties, since part of the resin flows through the micropores to the surface of the copper during the high pressure molding step, e.g., in the manufacture of glass cloth reinforced opoxy resin laminate. These patches of epoxy resin on the copper surface are highly harmful in the manufacture of the printed circuit both in the etching, plating and soldering steps. The thinner the copper foil the more difficult it is to avoid this problem. The present invention solves the problem, since the temporary base constitutes an effective barrier during the molding operation to preventing any flow through of resin onto the surface of the copper layer.\nBefore the temporary base with the copper layer is molded to the final base it is preferable to subject the copper to a surface treatment for improving the bond between the copper and the resin of the final base. This surface treatment often makes the surface of the copper uneven. The thickness of the deposited copper layer is therefore calculated as an average thickness. An average thickness of 10 \u03bcm corresponds to a surface weight of about 87 g/m2.\nThe method according to the present invention is further illustrated by the following examples.\nEXAMPLE 1\nAn aluminum foil (50 \u03bcm) was washed in a cleaning solution consisting of water, sodium carbonate and sodium phosphate. The foil then was washed in water and thereafter electroplate in a water solution containing\n\n Cu (CN).sub.2    25 g/lNaCN             20 g/lNa.sub.2 CO.sub.3            30 g/lNaOH              3 g/lRochelle Salt    70 g/l\nfor 2 minutes at 45\u00b0C. with a current density of 15 mA/cm2. After washing the foil was electroplated for 2 minutes with a current density of 50 mA/cm2 at a temperature of 42\u00b0C. in a water bath containing\n\n        CuSO.sub.4         170 g/l  H.sub.2 SO.sub.4          50 g/l\nThereafter the electroplating was carried out in the same bath at a current density of 200 mA/cm2 during 2 minutes for achieving a surface with high crystallinity and good adhesion to epoxy resin. A copper layer with a thickness of 5 \u03bcm was obtained.\nAfter the electroplating the aluminum foil was washed and dried whereupon it was placed on a few sheets of an epoxy resin impregnated glass web with the copper coated surface facing said sheets. The laminate was molded under pressure after which the aluminum foil was peeled off.\nThe copper layer bound to the final laminate had an adhesion to the base, so-called peel strength, of 8.5 lbs/in measured according to the standardized measuring method ASTM D/1867 after increasing the thickness of the copper layer by electroplating to 35 \u03bcm. The thickness of the metal layer obtained by electroplating can be changed in a simple manner by varying the electroplating time and/or the current density. On the laminate thus obtained a wiring pattern for the desired printed circuit was thereafter etched in a known manner.\nEXAMPLE 2\nA laminate was produced in the manner according to Example 1 but the aluminum foil was etched away in hydrochloric acid instead of being removed mechanically by tearing. The peel strength was 9.0 lbs/in.\nEXAMPLE 3\nA zinc foil (80 \u03bcm) was electroplated in a bath consisting of\n\n CuSO.sub.4 . 5H.sub.2 O           220 g/lH.sub.2 SO.sub.4           100 g/l\nduring 2 minutes at 20\u00b0C. with a current density of 100 mA/cm2. After washing the foil was electroplated during 20 seconds at room temperature in the same electroplating bath with a current density of 500 mA/cm2. Thereafter electroplating took place in the same bath for 30 seconds at a current density of 50 mA/cm2. A copper layer of 6 \u03bcm was thereby obtained. After molding according to Example 1 the zinc foil was etched away by means of hydrochloric acid. On the final laminate the copper layer had a peel strength of 12 lbs/in.\nEXAMPLE 4\nA steel foil (100 \u03bcm) was electroplated in a bath consisting of\n\n        CuP.sub.2 O.sub.7          50 g/l  K.sub.2 P.sub.2 O.sub.7         250 g/l\nfor 2 minutes at 35\u00b0C. with a current density of 24 mA/cm2. After washing the foil was electroplated for 3 minutes at 35\u00b0C. in a electroplating bath consisting of\n\n CuSO.sub.4 . 5H.sub.2 O           225 g/lH.sub.2 SO.sub.4           100 g/l\nat a current density of 100 mA/cm2.\nThe foil was thereafter electroplated at 35\u00b0C. in the same bath for 20 seconds at a current density of 500 mA/cm2. Thereafter the foil was electroplated once again at 35\u00b0C. in the same bath for 20 seconds at a current density of 100 mA/cm2.\nA copper layer with a thickness of 10 \u03bcm was obtained. After molding according to Example 1 the steel foil could be peeled off. The copper layer of the final laminate had a peel strength of 10.5 lbs/in.\nEXAMPLE 5\nAn aluminum foil was electroplated with a 5 \u03bcm thick copper layer in the manner described in Example 1. Thereafter the foil was molded under heat and pressure to a 75 \u03bcm thick plastic film of polyethylene terephthalate with the copper coated surface facing the film. As a binding agent heat curing polyurethane resin was used. After bonding the metal foil to the plastic film the aluminum foil could be peeled off. A flexible laminate consisting of a plastic film coated with a 5 \u03bcm thick copper layer was obtained.\nEXAMPLE 6\nAn aluminum foil was electroplated with a 10 \u03bcm thick copper layer in the manner described in Example 1. Thereafter the foil was placed on a sheet of \"non-woven\" cloth of polyester fiber which had been impregnated with a partly cured epoxy resin. The copper coated surface of the foil faced the impregnated cloth. After molding at a raised temperature the aluminum foil could be peeled off. The copper clad laminate obtained had good flexibility.\nEXAMPLE 7\nAn aluminum foil was electroplated with a 3 \u03bcm thick copper layer in the manner described in Example 1. Thereafter the copper clad surface of the foil was coated with a 75 \u03bcm thick layer of partly cured epoxy resin of the heat resistant type. A 1 mm thick copper plate was also coated with a 75 \u03bcm thick layer of partly cured epoxy resin of the same type. By electrolytical treatment the surface of the copper plate was placed in a condition giving good adhesion to epoxy resin. The foil and the copper plate were molded together under heat and pressure with the epoxy resin coated surfaces facing each other. Thereafter the aluminum foil was etched away in hydrochloric acid. The final laminate consisted of a copper plate and a 3 \u03bcm thick copper layer with an electrically insulating layer of epoxy resin therebetween. The copper plate assured effective dissipation of heat from a heated article which was soldered to the thin copper layer.\nFrom an economical point of view the most advantageous temporary base to be used according to the present invention is an aluminum foil which is cheap, easy to etch and gives less dangerous waste products from the point of view of environmental protection. The use of such a foil however, is not free from problems. It is difficult to obtain good adhesion of a metal layer on an aluminum foil by electroplating. This is true, i.a., if it is desired to apply a copper layer on the foil In this case it is usually necessary to utilize a cyanide containing plating bath which gives rise to waste products which are dangerous to the environment. The handling of cyanides during the plating process also involves risk.\nAccording to an embodiment of the present invention a temporary base of aluminum foil is used which is coated with a thin layer of zinc or tin, preferably of a thickness less than 2 \u03bcm, after which the thin metal layer is applied to the zinc or tin coating by electroplating. The adhesion between the meal, for instance copper, and the zinc or tin layer is very good, and one also can avoid the use of cyanide containing solutions, if desired. FIG. 11 shows how a temporary base 5 of aluminum has been provided with a thin layer of zinc 9 on which a copper coating 6 has been deposited by electroplating.\nEXAMPLE 8\nA hard-rolled aluminum foil was treated for 1 minute at room temperature in a zincate solution consisting of\n\n         Zno    95 g/l   NaOH  520 g/l\nAfter the treatment it was found that the foil was covered by a layer of zinc. The zinc layer was dissolved by immersion in 50% HNO3, whereby a clean aluminum surface was obtained. The aluminum foil was thereafter treated once again in the abovementioned zincate solution for 1 minute at room temperature, whereby a thin zinc layer with good adhesion to aluminum foil was obtained.\nThe aluminum foil thus treated was electroplated with nickel in a Watts' solution consisting of\n\n Nickel sulphate   300 g/lNickel chloride    45 g/lBoric acid        180 g/l\nfor 3 minutes at 50\u00b0C. and a current density of 50 mA/cm2. Thereafter the plating was continued for 1 minute in the same bath at 50\u00b0C. and with a current density of 150 mA/cm2.\nThe electroplated aluminum foil was placed on a few sheets of epoxy resin impregnated glass cloth with the nickel coated surface facing said cloth. The laminate was molded after which the aluminum foil with the zinc layer was dissolved by means of H2 SO4. A laminate coated with a 5 \u03bcm thick nickel layer was obtained. The strength of the bond between the nickel layer and the epoxy glass fiber laminate, i.e., the peel strength, measured on a 35 \u03bcm thick foil was 12 lbs/in.\nEXAMPLE 9\nA hard-rolled aluminum foil was immersed for 3 minutes in a 5% NaOH-solution. Thereafter the foil was immersed for 1 minute in a zincate solution of\n\n        NaOH      60 g/l  ZnO        6 g/l  FeCl.sub.3 . 6H.sub.2 O             2 g/l  Rochelle salt            55 g/l  NaNO.sub.3             1 g/l\nThe zinc-treated aluminum foil was electroplated with brass for 6 minutes at 60\u00b0C. and a current density of 40 mA/cm2 in a bath containing\n\n        CuCN    55 g/l  ZN(CN).sub.2          31 g/l  NaCN    95 g/l  Na.sub.2 CO.sub.3          35 g/l  NH.sub.4 OH          10 g/l\nA laminate was produced according to the procedure of Example 8. The temporary base was dissolved by means of H2 SO4 after the molding. A laminate with a 4 \u03bcm thick brass layer was obtained. The proportion between copper and zinc of the brass was about 70:30. The peel strength was 6 lbs/in.\nEXAMPLE 10\nA hard-rolled aluminum foil was zinc-treated according to the procedure of Example 8. Thereafter the foil was electroplated with brass for 5 minutes at room temperature and a current density of 50 mA/cm2 in a bath containing\n\n        CuCN      20 g/l  Zn(CN).sub.2            45 g/l  NaCN      50 g/l  Na.sub.2 CO.sub.3            32 g/l  NaOH      30 g/l  Rochelle Salt             5 g/l\nA laminate was produced according to the procedure of Example 8. The temporary base was dissolved by means of H2 SO4 after the molding. A laminate with a 5 \u03bcm thick layer of brass was obtained. The proportion between copper and zinc of the brass was about 40:60. The peel strength was 6 lbs/in.\nEXAMPLE 11\nAn aluminum foil which had been zinc-treated according to the procedure of Example 8 was plated at room temperature of 1, 2, 5 or 10 minutes respectively at a current density of 60 mA/cm2 in an acid copper solution containing\n\n CuSO.sub.4 . 5H.sub.2 O           200 g/lH.sub.2 SO.sub.4            70 g/l\nThereafter the foil was electroplated at room temperature in the same solution for 20 seconds at a current density of 200 mA/cm2 and thereafter for a further period of 20 seconds at a current density of 50 mA/cm2.\nLaminates were produced in the same manner as they were produced in Example 8. After the molding the temporary base was peeled off. The laminates were coated with a copper layer with a thickness of 4 \u03bcm, 5 \u03bcm, 8 \u03bcm and 13 \u03bcm respectively. The adhesion to the final base was about 11 lbs/in.\nThe thickness of the metal layer obtained by electroplating can thus simply be changed by varying the plating time which is shown in Example 11.\nFIG. 16 illustrates schematically a continuous process according to the present invention for the manufacture of a material for printed circuits consisting of an aluminum foil with a very thin copper coating deposited thereon. An aluminum foil 32 is drawn from a storage roll 31, is passed through cleaning bath 33 and washing bath 34 containing Na2 CO3, Na3 PO4 or NaOH and thereafter is pretreated by means of a zincate or stannate solution 35 for depositing a thin layer of zinc and tin, respectively on the aluminum foil. After a further washing in a suitable liquid 36 the foil is led down into solution 37 in a device for electroplating the surface of the foil coated with zinc and tin, respectively, for obtaining a thin copper layer thereon. Solution 37 for instance, can be a solution of copper sulphate, copper pyrophosphate or copper cyanide. The foil on the roll 40 serves as a cathode while plate 41 is an anode for the electroplating procedure. After the electroplating the product is washed in bath 43 and is dried by means of a device 38, whereupon the copper coated aluminum foil 42 thus obtained is wound up on the roll 39. The described process serves only as an illustration. Certain process steps can be eliminated and others can be added. Thus, for instance, further plating steps can be undertaken in certain cases.\nThe present invention also relates to a modified method which is especially advantageous technically and economically in the manufacture of certain types of metal coated plastic films. According to this method the thin metal layer carried by the temporary base is coated with a layer of a resin solution or a prepolymer or a solution of a prepolymer. It also is possible to use resin dispersions, melts or other liquid phases of the resin or its prepolymer. The deposited layer is transformed to solid phase for instance by evaporation of the solvent and polymerizing the prepolymer. Thereafter the temporary base can be removed, whereupon a plastic film coated with the very thin metal layer is obtained. Examples of metal coated plastic films which can be manufactured with advantage by means of this process are films of polybenzoxazole, polybenzimidazole, polyimide and polybutadiene resins. These plastics have good dielectric properties and good heat resistance which is advantageous in printed circuitry. Such metal coated plastic films find use for instance in the manufacture of flexible printed circuits.\nFIG. 17 illustrates schematically a continuous process according to this modified method. From a storage roll 51 for a foil 52 which if desired, can consist of the final product 42 obtained by the process according to FIG. 16, the foil is drawn horizontally over a support 53, it being assumed that the underside of the horizontal foil is constituted by a temporary base in the form of a metal foil 52a and the upper side is constituted by a metal foil deposited on the temporary base by means of electroplating and consisting of a thin layer 52b, for instance of copper. From a container 54 is drawn a fluid prepolymer 55 of a resin suitable for forming a final, insulating base of the material for printed circuits to be produced. The metal layer is coated with the prepolymer which is thereafter brought to final polymerization by means of a suitable apparatus 57 whereby a strong, flexible film 56 is obtained. After removing the metal foil 52a which is wound up on a roll 59 the film 56 with the thin metal coating bonded thereto is wound up on a roll 58. For the sake of simplicity further process steps which can be undertaken for instance pretreatment of the component foil materials have not been shown in FIG. 17. From the roll 59 the metal foil can go to replating, if desired. Instead of peeling off the temporary base the latter can be removed in any other manner for instance by etching, which can be carried out with advantage in immediate connection with the manufacture of the printed circuit.\nEXAMPLE 12\nAn aluminum foil with a copper layer with a thickness of 5 \u03bcm was produced according to Example 11. The free copper surface was coated with a layer of a solution consisting of\n\n Polybenzoxazole, prepolymer              15 parts by weightDimethylacetamide  85 parts by weight\nThe dimethylacetamide was evaporated in an oven while gradually increasing the temperature from 60\u00b0C. to 160\u00b0C. for 60 minutes. Thereafter the temperature was increased to 300\u00b0C. which temperature was maintained for 45 minutes. During the last mentioned treatment which was carried out in a nitrogen gas atmosphere the prepolymer underwent a chemical reaction so that an aromatic polybenzoxazole was obtained.\nThereafter the aluminum foil was etched away by means of hydrochloric acid. As a result of 25 \u03bcm thick film of polybenzoxazole plastic coated with a 5 \u03bcm thick copper layer was obtained. The plastic film proper had high flexibility and very good heat resistance at temperatures up to 250\u00b0C. The tensile strength was 1050 kp/cm2 at 20\u00b0C.\nEXAMPLE 13\nAn aluminum foil having a thickness of 50 \u03bcm was washed at room temperature in an alkaline solution containing 5% NaOH. The foil was then treated in a solution containing 5% NaOH, 0.5% ZnO and 0.1% FeCl3. After this treatment the aluminum foil was coated with a thin layer of zinc (< 0.3 \u03bcm). At this stage it would have been possible to plate the foil with copper, for instance in a copper cyanide solution. In an acid copper solution the result might, however, not be good, because of the difficulty of avoiding blistering.\nIn order to treat the foil so that a better result would be obtained with plating in an acid copper solution, the zinc coated foil of aluminum was immersed in a solution containing 40 g/l NiCl2 . 6H2 O. By means of sulphuric acid the acidity of the solution was adusted to pH = 2. By an electrochemical reaction zinc was replaced by nickel in this solution, that is, metallic nickel was precipitated on the foil while zinc was dissolved. It should be pointed out that it is important that the treatment is carried out within a correctly adjusted time period. A period of treatment which is too short will result in a layer of nickel, which is unevenly distributed over the surface of the foil so that zinc and also aluminum metal will be exposed to the acid copper solution subsequently applied. On the other hand, with too long a period of treatment in the nickel solution the aluminum foil under the layer of zinc will be attacked to an unpermissible extent so that it will be weakened. The correct duration of the treatment in the above mentioned solution of nickel appeared to be between 30 and 150 seconds at room temperature.\nThe nickel coated foil was plated at room temperature in a solution containing 220 g/l CuSO4 . 5H2 O and 100 g/l H2 SO4, first during a period of 135 seconds with a current density of 3 A/dm2, then during 45 seconds at 14 A/dm2 and finally during 60 seconds at 4 A/dm2. After this treatment the foil had a coating of copper the thickness of which was about 5 \u03bcm. The free surface of the copper coating had a structure that resulted in good adhesion to the final base, for instance an epoxy laminate.\nThe foil thus produced was washed and dried, whereafter it was placed on a few sheets of epoxy resin impregnated glass web with the copper coated surface facing said sheets. After molding at increased temperature for hardening the epoxy resin a laminate was obtained consisting of an electrically insulating plate of glass fiber reinforced epoxy plastic with a metal foil bonded to its surface. The production of this laminate could be performed without blistering occurring between the layers of metal. The aluminum foil was etched away in a hydrochloric acid solution. The laminate finally obtained consisted of a layer of copper having a thickness of about 5 \u03bcm directly bonded to the epoxy plastic and covered by a thin (thickness less thant 0.5 \u03bcm) layer of nickel.\nAt the manufacture of the printed circuit the thin layer of nickel can be removed from the copper, if necessary. A rapid and easy method for such removal is etching in ferric chloride solution. As this solution also dissolves copper, the length of the period must be carefully adjusted, so that the treatment is interrupted when the nickel is removed and before an appreciable part of the copper is etched away. A somewhat more complicated but more reliable method is electrochemical elimination, at which the nickel can be removed selectively. Such a method will be described in the following example.\nEXAMPLE 14\nA laminate is produced as described in Example 13. After the aluminum foil was removed, the copper was found to be covered by a layer of nickel, the thickness of which was about 0.2 \u03bcm. The metal coating on the laminate was used as an anode in an electrolytic cell containing a solution which was free of halogen and consisted of three parts of concentrated sulphuric acid and two parts of distilled water at room temperature. With a current density of 2 A/dm2 the layer of nickel was dissolved out without noticeable attack on the copper layer.\nThe thin layer of nickel can thus be removed from the copper in various manners, If desired. However, it was shown to be possible to produce printed circuits without removal of the nickel layer. At a so called through-holes plating with simultaneous increase of the thickness of the conductors by plating with copper a good adhesion between the copper and the nickel layer was obtained.\nIn the manufacture of certain types of printed circuits the thin layer of nickel may be of great advantage. In this case the thickness of the nickel layer may, if required, be increased by electrolytic plating. Printed circuits having nickel coated conductors of copper enable connection of electronic components by welding instead of soldering and this may be required at, for instance, printed circuits with a high degree of miniaturization This is a further advantage with the invention in addition to the advantages mentioned above in connection with the plating process.\nEXAMPLE 15\nA rolled foil of aluminum having a thickness of 50 \u03bcm was rinsed in a solution of 5% by weight of NaOH in water during 5 minutes at 20\u00b0C. Thereafter the foil was washed in water and was then plated at 60\u00b0C. in a water solution containing\n\n Cu.sub.2 P.sub.2 O.sub.7 . 4 H.sub.2 O                     40 g/lH.sub.2 C.sub.2 O.sub.4 . 2 H.sub.2 O (oxalic acid)                     60 g/lK.sub.4 P.sub.2 O.sub.7   90 g/lNH.sub.4 OH to pH = 5.7\nAfter the plating the foil was washed and dried, whereafter it was placed on a few sheets of an epoxy resin impregnated glass web with the copper coated surface facing said sheets. After molding at a pressure of 50 kp/cm2 and a temperature of 165\u00b0C. during 45 minutes a laminate was obtained from which the foil of aluminum could easily be peeled off by hand. The adhesion between aluminum and copper was measured according to ASTM D-1867  and is shown in the following table which also indicates the values of the current density and the plating time at the process.\n\n               Table______________________________________  Current Density Plating time AdhesionExample  A/dm.sup.2      seconds      lbs/inch______________________________________1      5.7             300          0.032      8.6             200          1.073      11.4            150          1.47______________________________________\nThe adhesion was measured according to ASTM D-1867.\nThe copper plated aluminum foil could be handled without the layers of metal becoming separated from each other. It also turned out to be possible to roll up the foil on a cylindrical rod and then unroll it without the copper being loosened from the aluminum foil. As the laminate has been molded and the aluminum foil had been peeled off a copper layer having a thickness of about 5 \u03bcm was obtained on the final base. By etching in 20% ammonium persulphate all the copper could be removed from the surface of the epoxy laminate, that is, no penetration of resin through the micropores could be observed.\nThe present invention is not limited to the embodiments and examples shown and described since they can be modified in different manners within the scope of the invention.\n", "claims": "\nWhat is claimed is:\n \n1.

No. 200,052, filed Nov. 18, 1971.\nThis invention relates to an electrode substrate which forms a support for an electrode in an electrochemical cell. More particularly it relates to porous sheet material composed of graphite particles enmeshed in a web of fibers of polytetrafluoroethylene, and to a method of producing such material. This invention specifically deals with the construction of an electrode substrate or electrode support of a low cost chemically inert material.\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\nIn the construction of electrochemical fuel cells it is desirable to use low cost construction components, whenever possible. This is not always a simple thing to achieve because in many instances, especially in acid-electrolyte fuel cells, the electrolyte is extremely corrosive and thereby attacks many common construction materials.\nAn electrochemical fuel cell is a device for converting chemical energy of a fuel directly into electrical energy by means of a galvanic process. The components of a fuel cell consist of an electrolyte which conducts ions between two electrodes, a positive or reducing electrode, and a negative or oxidizing electrode.\nThe negative electrode is sometimes referred to as the fuel electrode and the positive electrode is most commonly an oxygen or air electrode. The electrodes are brought in intimate contact with the electrolyte where galvanic reactions take place when the external circuit is closed. It is next necessary to be able to remove and transfer electrons to and from the electrodes by means of appropriate conductors. Simultaneously it is necessary to be able to supply fuel and oxygen to the electrode to provide a continuous source of the active material. Therefore, in addition to the electrodes themselves, there must be provided access to the active site via the fuel and oxidizing gas compartments in the cell.\nIn many types of fuel cells, the electrodes are supported by metallic grids. The metallic grids, in addition to being mechanical supports, act as electronic current conductors as well as providing porous structures through which gas can readily pass. In the case of acid fuel cells, which are an important embodiment of the present invention, the choice of electronic conductors to be used as metallic grids in the electrode assemblies is severely limited by the corrosive nature of the acids. Only a very few metallic materials are capable of withstanding the corrosive action of concentrated sulfuric and phosphoric acids commonly used in fuel cells. Typical metals which can provide the above function are platinum, tantalum, and sometimes niobium if the temperatures are not too high.\nMetal alloys which might be compatible with the acid are generally poor materials for use in fuel cells because of severe oxidizing and reducing conditions that exist at the electrode during the fuel cell operation.\nWe have discovered that graphitic materials are ideally suited to withstand the corrosive nature of phosphoric and sulfuric acids over the entire range of acid concentration and operating temperatures commonly used in fuel cells. This application is directed to solving the problem of how to produce the graphitic materials in an appropriate form to provide the additional functions of gas accessibility and current collection as well as mechanical electrode support.\nThe four main requirements for an electrode substrate in the fuel cell are good electrical conductivity, good gas diffusion characteristics, resistance to the electrolyte from a corrosion viewpoint, and good thermal conductivity. The latter characteristic is almost invariably met when the higher priority electrical conductivity criterion is met.\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nThis application describes how to fabricate porous graphitic electrode support materials, which exhibit equal or superior properties to commonly used metallic grid materials but greatly reduce the cost, thereby increasing the feasibility of commercially available electrochemical fuel cells.\nIt is therefore an object of this invention to provide a porous graphitic electrode substrate material suitable for use as an electrode support in electrochemical cells.\nIt is a further object of this invention to provide an electrode support material which allows reacting gas accessibility to the active fuel cell catalyst at sufficient rates to maintain meaningful operational conditions in electrochemical fuel cells.\nIt is still a further object of this invention to provide an electrode support which has sufficient electronic conductivity to be able to remove the current produced at the fuel cell electrodes without suffering high IR losses, commonly called voltage drops, by virtue of ohmic effects in the electrodes themselves.\nAnother object is to provide an electrode support for electrochemical cells having good thermal conductivity.\nThese and other objects of this invention will become clear in the description that follows, taken in conjunction with the drawings wherein:\nFIG. 1 is a schematic sectional view of a conventional bipolar stack fuel cell;\nFIG. 2 is a schematic representation of the electrode substrate and electrodes; and\nFIG. 3 is an enlarged schematic of the graphite-PTFE electrode-electrode substrate structure.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING\nAs shown in FIG. 2, the electrode structure is made up of a substrate 10 of graphite and PTFE and a thin metal-PTFE catalyst layer 11 supported thereon. The substrate 10 is generally about 10 mils in thickness, although the thickness usually may vary from 5 to 15 mils. Greater thickness may be used but may cause either diffusion or polarization losses. Lesser thickness may be acceptable in certain applications, although in-plane resistance may increase. The relative quantities of PTFE, where sintered and employed with a thermosetting resin, in the substrate can vary from as low as about 1% by weight to as much as 10% by weight, the balance being graphite. The metal in the catalyst layer 11 is preferably platinum black for cathodes, although other metals such as palladium, or other precious metal blacks or combinations thereof can be used. The metal-PTFE catalyst layer 11 is deposited on the substrate 10 by the procedure described in our copending application entitled FUEL CELL ELECTRODE originally filed on Nov. 18, 1971 as Ser. No. 200,222, now continuation application Ser. No. 428,826, filed on Dec. 27, 1973 and entitled A METHOD OF MAKING A FUEL CELL ELECTRODE BY COMPRESSING A LEACHED MASS. It is generally about 0.5 to 3 mil in thickness.\nFIG. 3 illustrates the electrode structure in more detail. The substrate 10 is illustrated as made up of graphite particles 12 held together in a web or matrix of PTFE fibers or elongated particles. Since the PTFE forms usually only a small fraction of the substrate 10 it does not coat or cover the graphite particles 12 and the latter are in good electrical connection with each other, thus providing good electrical conductivity. The electrode 11 is illustrated as composed of metal (e.g. platinum black) particles 13 held in a web or matrix of PTFE, the latter comprising 15 to 35 weight percent of the electrode 11. It is seen that there are pores of interstices between the graphite particles 12 in the substrate 10 through which gas may pass, such as oxygen, air or hydrogen. In the substrate of this application the mean pore size is 10 microns and ranges from 6 to 12 microns. There are similar, though smaller, pores or interstices between the metal particles 13 in the electrode 11 into which the electrolyte may partially penetrate.\nFIG. 1 is a schematic view of a complete fuel cell embodying the graphite-PTFE substrate of this application. In FIG. 1, 10 represents the porous graphite-PTFE substrate, about 10 mils in thickness, and 11 is the thin film platinum-PTFE anode, about 1.5 mils in thickness. A gasket 14 of inert resin such as a fluoroelastomer like \"Viton\" or PTFE, about 30 mils in thickness, seals the cell. The electrolyte matrix 15 is about 20 mils in thickness, of porous acid resistant material in which is absorbed an electrolyte such as sulphuric or phosphoric acid. The other side of the electrolyte matrix 15 is in contact with a thin film cathode 16 on a porous graphite-PTFE substrate or support 17. The structures of the cathode 16 and support 17 are substantially the same as those of the anode 11 and the substrate 10, respectively, although the specific catalysts in anode 11 and cathode 16 may be quite different. Adjacent and in contact with the cathode support 17 is a conductive bipolar plate 18, about 100 mils in thickness, which contains gas manifolds (now shown) which provide access of an oxidizing gas (e.g., air or oxygen) to the cathode 16 through the porous support 17. The bipolar plate 18 is electrically conductive and serves to transmit current from one cell to the adjacent one. The outer edges 18a of the plate 18 may be thicker than the main body and serve as supports for the gaskets 14. The structure, production and composition of this bipolar plate are described in our copending application entitled BIPOLAR FUEL CELL PLATE originally filed on November 18, 1971 as Ser. No. 200,022, now continuation application Serial No. 399,620, filed on September 21, 1973.\nAs shown in FIG. 1, the elements 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 form a complete fuel cell. By the same token, the elements 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28 form another complete cell in series with the first fuel cell. The elements 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 28a are the same as 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 18a. Additional fuel cells can be stacked on each other in series as illustrated in FIG. 1 to provide a unit with the desired voltage.\nIn the operation of a fuel cell as shown in FIG. 1, the electrolyte matrix 15 and 25 is filled with an aqueous acid such as sulphuric or phosphoric. The fuel, hydrogen gas, is flowed through the porous anode support 10 to the platinum anode 11 via gas manifolds. The oxidant air or oxygen gas, is flowed through the gas manifolds in the bipolar plate 18 and through the porous cathode support 16 to the platinum cathode 16. The fuel is oxidized at the anode 11 and the oxidant is reduced at the cathode 16, causing ions to flow between the cathode and anode, thus producing an electric current which can be conducted out of the cell via the conductive support 10 and the conductive bipolar plate 18. A stack of cells in series operates in the same manner.\nIn FIG. 1 the position of the graphite-PTFE electrode substrate 10 relative to the electrode 11 and bipolar plate in the fuel cell construction is shown. In FIG. 2 the detailed relationship between the electrode substrate 10 and the electrode 11 is shown and, therefore, electrolyte and gas movements to and from the electrode are shown. In consideration of FIG. 2 it is obvious that the electrode substrate should be thin as possible without sacrificing mechanical integrity and should be as porous as possible without sacrificing good electrical conductivity, with the exception that if the substrate is very thin then the gas passages in the bipolar plate must also be thin to avoid excessive inplane resistive losses. The pure graphite materials themselves have electrical conductivity several orders of magnitude higher than are required to make a good electrode substrate. However, conventional graphitic structures are extremely brittle and have porosities that are relatively low. Further, the pore size distribution of conventional graphitic material is extremely small, in the sub-micron range, resulting in a high tortuosity gas passage thus producing a barrier to gas diffusion resulting in concentration polarization in the fuel cell. In our invention we have circumvented these difficulties in fabricating electrode substrate materials by a judicious choice of graphite particles. If the graphite particles are used in manufacturing of the substrate are extremely fine, the substrate itself will contain a very narrow and small pore size distribution which causes the aforementioned concentration polarization phenomenon. Large particles of carbon in the substrate, on the other hand, will produce an irregular surface upon which to deposit the electrode, resulting in poor electrical conductivity, loss of active area, and pore contact with the electrolyte matrix. It is, therefore, necessary to use carbon particles in the appropriate size range of between about -100 and +200 mesh.\nA further requirement is that as much graphite as possible be incorporated in the electrode substrate. Moreover, graphite per se is not in itself sufficient to make up the entire electrode substrate assembly since some agent is required to bond or hold the graphite particles together. Like the graphite this agent must be capable of withstanding the corrosive nature of the electrolyte used in the electrochemical cell. But, unlike the graphite, it is not necessary that this material possess the requisite of electrical conductivity properties, provided that the material can be used in relatively small amounts. In our invention we have developed a method of bonding the graphite particles of the substrate together using very small amounts of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) powder. Electrode substrates have been made with as little as 6% by weight and as high as 32% by weight of PTFE, although the latter figure results in resistiveties that are too high.\nIn Table 1 are tabulated the electrical conductivities of a variety of substrate materials made up with a variety of graphitic materials. We have found that it is not only desirable to have single graphitic particles in the electrode substrate but it is sometimes advantageous to use several different types of graphite materials in the substrate itself to enhance the strength and electrical conductivity of the substrate.\n\n               TABLE 1______________________________________CONDUCTIVITY OF POROUS GRAPHITE SUPPORTS     Graphite Particle Size, microns______________________________________     44        74-120     121-244Wt. % PTFE  Resistivity ohm-cm.______________________________________6           0.2         0.3        0.358           .25         .5         1.116          .4          1.0        3.524          .6          1.6        6.032          .8          2.1        --______________________________________\nThe following examples illustrate different processes by which the electrode substrates are manufactured. In general, the construction of the electrode substrate consists of several steps.\nIn the first step, the desired graphitic materials are mixed with the desired amount of PTFE in a blender in mineral spirits or other suitable organic liquid such as Stoddard solvent or other hydrocarbon or halogenated hydrocarbon liquid. After blending for a short period of time the materials are filtered, preferably on a Buchner or centrifugal filter, and the filter cake is then placed between rollers or between a roller and a flat surface and the material is worked between the rollers until a bonding consistency is set up between the particles of the substrate, mainly through the particles of PTFE stretching and forming interlocking fibers. At this point, the material is rolled into a flat sheet of the electrode substrate of the desired thicknesses and the substrate is allowed to dry to remove the organic liquid. Then, the substrate is ready to be used as the electrode support in an electrochemical cell. In some instances, it may be desirable to sinter the PTFE bonding agent in the substrate although this is not always required and depends on the particular electrochemical cell system in question.\nSubstrates made in accordance with this invention have been operated in fuel cells and their fuel cell performance compared with that of similar fuel cells operating with conventional grid structures. These results are summarized in Table 2. It can be readily seen there is no appreciable difference in operating performance between those cells employing metallic grids for the support of the electrode and those employing the electrode substrate described in this application. This fact is extremely important because a tremendous saving has been made in substituting the inexpensive graphitic material for the rather expensive metal grids.\nIt is possible that other types of electrode substrates can be used in place of particulate carbon. It is not uncommon for fibrous carbon filaments to be made into an electrode substrate. However, the results obtained with this type of electrode are generally inferior to those obtained with the electrodes described herein. For the first part this is because the fibrous carbon electrode substrate has a very irregular surface which cannot readily support low loadings of precious metal catalyst. In other words, a greater amount of precious metal catalysts is required on such substrates. Second, the graphite-PTFE substrate is made by a process which is considerably less expensive than the process for making graphite fibers. So again, a very positive gross advantage is realized in using the substrate as described in this invention and in the following examples.\nEXAMPLE 1\nA mixture of high purity graphite particles of a -100 +200 mesh screen size were mixed with polytetrafluoroethylene powder so that the weight of the PTFE was 7.5 percent of the mixture. The materials were blended in mineral spirits for approximately 3 minutes in a high-speed blender. The blended mixture was next filtered through a centrifugal filter and the homogenous carbon-PTFE mixture was then rolled to a thickness of 10 mils in a series of 10 milling operations which worked the graphite-PTFE mixture to a consistency such that it stuck to itself and could support its own weight. The 10-mil sheet, so rolled, was then air dried until the mineral spirits evaporated and the resultant substrate was ready for the next step in the process.\nIn the next step the dried substrate material was pressed at a pressure of approximately 400 psi to slightly densify and strengthen the material. The material prepared by the above process exhibited approximately 55% total porosity, had a conductivity in the plane of the substrate of 0.0520 ohm-centimeter and a conductivity through the substrate or perpendicular to the substrate plane of 0.070 ohm-centimeter.\nIn the porous substrate 75% of the pores had a pore size larger than 0.1 micron and 60% of the pores had a pore size larger than 3.75 microns. This material was used in fuel cells, and the results are shown in Table 2.\n\n               TABLE 2______________________________________COMPARISON OF TANTALUM SCREEN AND GRAPHITE-PTFEELECTRODE SUPPORTS IN TERMS OF AIR ELECTRODE PERFORMANCE          Tantalum  Graphite-PTFE          ScreenTime   Current Density                Voltage Wrt H.sub.2                            Voltage Wrt H.sub.2(hours)  (amp/sq.ft.)

In this example the electrode was made up of essentially 7.5% by weight of PTFE, 77% particulate carbon as in Example 1, and 15.5% carbon fibers.\nUsing this formulation it was possible to produce electrodes with total porosities of 70%, a parallel conductivity of 0.05 ohm-centimeter, a perpendicular conductivity of 0.065 ohm-centimeter, pressed at a pressure of 1000 pounds per square inch.\nEXAMPLE 3\nIn this example the materials were processed again by the same method as described in the previous examples, except that the composition of the substrate was altered to 2% PTFE, 70% particulate carbon, 18% fibrous carbon and 10% polyphenylenesulfide (PPS). This material is processed in the same way, but in the final step was subjected to a pressure of 1000 pounds per square inch and a temperature of 600\u00b0F. The effect of the temperature was to cause the PPS material to take a set under pressure. The result was an electrode substrate which exhibited the following properties.\nIt was 60% porous, had a conductivity of 0.07 ohm-centimeter in the plane of the electrode, 0.7 ohm-centimeter perpendicular to the plane of the electrode. The material was more rigid; this can be a desirable feature in certain applications.\n", "claims": "\nWe claim:\n \n1.

No. 1,051,269) that organolithiums such as n-butyllithium will form chelate complexes with certain bifunctional Lewis bases, particularly di-tertiary amines such as tetramethylethanediamine. According to this patent, the complexes are prepared by mixing the organolithium and the di-tertiary diamine, generally in the presence of a hydrocarbon solvent or excess amounts of the diamine. The chelate complex forms quite rapidly since the organolithium and the diamine form a homogeneous solution (in a hydrocarbon or excess diamine) and the chelate complex may then be isolated by removal of the diluent.\nIt is also well known (e.g. see British Pat. No. 1,031,179) that alkali metals such as sodium or lithium in finely divided form can be reacted with certain organic compounds to produce the corresponding organo alkali metal salts, providing the reaction is carried out in the presence of certain amines in which at least one of the amino groups is a primary or secondary amino group. Thus, a lithium dispersion (in heptane) can upon admixture with ethylene diamine, yield N-lithioethylene diamine; this latter matter upon treatment with acetylene will yield monolithium acetylide ethylene diamine.\nIt is also well known (U.S. Pat. No. 2,726,133) that lithium chloride may be extracted from crude aqueous lithium chloride with the aid of an inert solvent of 3 to 8 carbon atoms containing at least one nitrogen or oxygen atom such as the alkanols, corresponding ketones and aldehydes, pyridine and quinoline.\nBedell in his U.S. Pat. No. 3,258,490, teaches the use of primary amines to prepare insoluble high melting compounds of lithium perchlorate. Despite Bedell's reference to \"chelation,\" it is apparent from the properties of his complexes that they are not chelates but are open chain polymeric complexes. Bedell does not show, suggest or teach that tertiary diamines are capable of forming similar complexes or that they are in any way equivalent to primary diamines.\nTHE PRESENT INVENTION\nThis application is a continuation-in-part of Ser. No. 808,328 filed Mar. 18, 1969 entitled \"Inorganic Lithium Amine Complexes.\" It has now been unexpectedly discovered that a complex of certain inorganic lithium salts and certain complexing agents can be readily prepared. This is highly surprising for the various reasons set forth immediately below.\nAt the outset, it was surprising that a complex of an inorganic lithium salt could be prepared since the general chemistry (i.e. properties, reactivity, etc.) of inorganic lithium salts differ drastically from that of organolithium compounds or lithium metal. Many organolithium compounds are generally soluble in hydrocarbons and thus readily form complexes upon admixture with certain complexing agents. However, inorganic lithium salts are generally insoluble in hydrocarbons; thus, it was wholly unexpected to find that when many inorganic lithium salts were mixed with a hydrocarbon containing the complexing agent, the inorganic lithium salts dissolved in the reaction medium and stable complexes of the chelating agent with the lithium salt could be obtained from the reaction mixture.\nIt is well known that one of the significant factors used in predicting whether a reaction can be accomplished with a given material is whether the lattice energy of such material is low enough to be overcome by the other reactant so as to form a new compound. Thus, it was highly surprising to find that the inorganic lithium salts which have significantly higher lattice energies than those of organolithium compounds, nevertheless can form complexes with the same type (and indeed many more types) of complexing agent as those used in conjunction with the organolithium compounds.\nTHE LITHIUM COMPOUND\nThe first component of the novel chelated lithium compounds of this invention is a lithium compound having a lattice energy no greater than about that of lithium hydride, preferably no greater than about 210 kilocalories per mole (measured at about 18\u00b0C). The lattice energies of various inorganic lithium salts may be found in the \"Handbook of Electrochemical Constants\" by Roger Parsons (Academic Press 1959).\nThe lithium compounds useful for this invention must have less than the requisite maximum lattice energy and they will normally have melting points less than about 650\u00b0C. The lithium compounds for the purposes of this invention, have no hydrocarbon radical bonded directly to the lithium atom and any hydrocarbon radical present in the anion moiety must be indirectly bonded to the lithium through a third atom which cannot be nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus or sulfur. Thus, lithium compounds such as n-butyllithium and phenyllithium are outside the scope of this invention. Similarly, compounds of the type LiOR, LiNHR or LiNR2, LiPR2, LiOOCR are outside the scope of this invention. On the other hand, compounds of the type LiCN, LiSCN, LiAlR2 Cl2, LiAlH(OR)3, LiBH(OR3), LiAlR3 H are within the scope of this invention.\nSpecific nonlimiting examples of useful inorganic lithium salts are those in which the anion is: azide, chlorate, cyanide, fluosulfonate, chloride, bromide, iodide, iodate, nitrate, hypochlorite, nitrite, thiocyanate, perchlorate, Br3, I3, ClBr2, IBr2, ICl4, BrF4, IF6.\nAlso useful are those lithium compounds in which the anion is a complex metal anion which may be represented by th formula R\"n MXm wherein n is an integer of 0 to 6 inclusive depending on the valence of M, m is an integer and (n + m - 1) equals the valence of M, X is a halogen, R\" is a C1 -C20 alkyl, aryl or aralkyl radical and M is a metal selected from the group consisting of beryllium; magnesium; Group Ib elements; Group IIb elements; Group III elements, Group IVa elements other than carbon and silicon; Group Va elements other than nitrogen; and the transition metals, i.e. subgroup b of Groups IV through VIII. The Periodic Table employed in describing this invention is that which appears on the back cover of \"Handbook of Chemistry and Physics\" (Chemical Rubber Co., 49th Edition).\nNonlimiting examples of useful complex metal anions include the hydridoaluminates, the hydridoborates, the chloroaluminates (tetra-, hepta-, etc.), the aluminum alkyl halides, AuBr4, BF4, BeCl4, SnCl6, PF6, TiCl6, FeCl4, Cr(CO)5 I, MnCl3, Ni(CN)4, VF6, HgCl3, B2 H7, UF4, AsF6.\nPreferably, the lithium compound is one of the following: lithium chloride, lithium bromide, lithium iodide, lithium aluminum hydride, lithium borohydride, lithium nitrate, lithium hexafluorophosphate, lithium tetrafluoborate, lithium tetraphenylborate, LiAl(C2 H5)H3, LiAl(C2 H5)2 H2, LiAl(C2 H5)3 H, LiAl(C2 H5)4, lithium perchlorate, lithium azide, LiAsF6 and Li2 BeF4. More preferably, the lithium compound of the subject invention is selected from the group consisting of LiAlRn X.sub.(4-n) and LiAlRm X'.sub.(4-m) wherein R is a hydrogen or a C1 -C20 hydrocarbyl group, X is selected from the group consisting of chlorine, bromine, iodine; X' is selected from the group consisting of C1 -C20 alkoxide, C1 -C20 thioalkoxide, C2 -C40 hydrocarbyl secondary amides and C2 -C40 hydrocarbyl secondary phosphides; n is an integer from 0 to 4, and m is an integer from 1 to 4. Typical examples are LiAlH3 Cl, LiAlR3 Cl, LiAlR3 Br, LiAlR3 I, LiAlR3 NR2, LiAlR2 [NR2 ]2, LiAlH2 (NR2)2, LiAlH2 ORNR2, LiAlH2 BrOR, LiAlH2 BrNR2, LiAlHBrORNR2, LiAlH3 SR and LiALH2 NR2 SR.\nSpecific nonlimiting examples of the lithium compounds of this invention are LiAlH[N(C2 H5)2 ]3,LiAlH2 [N(C3 H7)2 ]2, LiAlH3 N(C10 H21)2, LiAlH3 OC2 H5, LiAlCl(C4 H9)3, LiAlBr(C4 H9)3, LiAlI(C4 H9)3, LiAlH2 BrC4 H9, LiAlH2 N(C10 H21)2 OC2 H5, LiAlH3 N(C6 H11)2, LiAlHBr(i-C4 H9)2, LiAlH2 N(C2 H5)2 SC6 H5, LiAl(C2 H5)2 N(C2 H5)2 Br, LiAl(C6 H5)3 Br, LiAlCl2 BrC2 H5, LiAlH3 SC8 H17, LiAlHBrOC2 H5 N(C10 H21)2, LiAlH2 ISCH3, LiAl(C2 H5)2 C20 H41 Br, LiAlH3 OC6 H5, LiAlH3 SC20 H41, LiAlH3 OC20 H41, LiAlH3 P(C6 H11)2 and the like.\nMost preferred are the lithium compounds having the above formulas wherein R is a hydrogen atom, n is an integer from 1 to 4, and m is an integer from 1 to 4.

Particularly preferred species of the chelating tertiary polyamines are N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-1,2-ethanediamine, N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-1,3-propanediamine, N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-1,2-cyclohexane-diamine (cis, trans or mixtures), N,N,N',N\",N\"-pentamethyl diethylenetriamine, N,N,N',N\",N\"',N'\"-hexamethyl triethylenetetramine, tris-(\u03b2-dimethylaminoethyl)amine and higher alkyl derivatives thereof such as the corresponding tris-(\u03b2-diethylaminoethyl)amine, dipyrrolidylethane, etc.\nThe chelate of the lithium compound may be readily prepared by mixing the selected lithium compound (having the requisite maximum lattice energy) with the selected chelating agent in the absence of solvent. Such mixing may also be accomplished in the presence of inert hydrocarbons, e.g. C4 -C20 alkanes (e.g. pentane, heptane, hexadecane); C6 -C20 aromatics (e.g. benzene, toluene, xylene, dibutylnaphthalene); halogenated aromatics (e.g. chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, hexafluorobenzene); heterocyclic compounds (e.g. pyridine, pyrrole, furan, thiophene, sulfolane, borazole); or mixtures thereof. Preferred solvents include the aromatics, halogenated aromatics and saturated hydrocarbons.\nThe amount of the diluent is not critical and amounts in the range of 0 to 99.9 wt. %, based on the chelated lithium compound may be conveniently employed. Thus, the chelate can be prepared in the absence of solvents, in the form of pastes and in solutions.\nIn those situations where the lithium compound of choice is not solubilized by the admixture of the chelating agent and solvent, the chelate may be formed by mixing the lithium compound (which is preferably in finely divided form) with the chelating agent of choice in stoichiometric amounts, or preferably, with excess chelating agent.\nAnother method for preparing the chelate involves anion exchange. In this method, the chelating agent of choice is mixed with lithium compound (in which the anion is not the desired anion) by one of the methods described above. Thereafter the resultant chelate is subjected to anion exchange in the presence of a metal salt (or other well known techniques such as anion exchange resins) containing the anion of choice; alternatively, all components may be mixed simultaneously and both complexation and metathesis occurs in situ.\nAnother method for preparing the chelate is analogous to the preceding method except that here the anion is one of choice, but the chelating agent is not one of choice. After preparing the non-preferred chelate by one of the above methods, the non-preferred chelating agent moiety is exchanged for the preferred chelating agent moiety by mixing the chelate (utilizing one of the former methods) with the desired chelating agent and thereafter recovering the desired chelate.\nRegardless of the method employed the preparation of the chelate is preferably carried out under anhydrous conditions, although this is not always necessary in some applications, such as separations.\nThe chelate may be readily prepared at temperatures of about -50\u00b0C. to about 200\u00b0C.; preferably 0 to 100\u00b0C.; the latter temperature range is preferred because of convenience and also since higher temperatures favor dissociation of the less stable chelates. In general, from 0.25 to 50, preferably 0.5 -10 moles of chelating agent per mole of lithium compound is employed; the chelating agent may be employed as a solvent. However, it should be understood that the amount of chelating agent employed may influence the structure of the resultant chelate. Thus, it has been found possible to prepare chelates of the following types:\n1. Two moles of lithium compound to one mole of chelating agent such as (LiBr)2.hexamethyltriethylenetetramine.\n2. One mole of lithium compound to one mole of chelating agent, such as LiBr.pentamethyldiethylenetriamine, LiI.tetramethylethylenediamine.\n3. One mole of lithium compound to two moles of chelating agent, such as LiAlH4.2 (tetramethylethylenediamine), LiAlH4 .2(tetramethylmethanediamine), LiBr.2(tetramethylethylenediamine).\nOf course, the minimum amount of chelating agent should be that stoichiometric amount required to produce the desired type of chelate (where more than one type of chelate is possible from a particular lithium compound and a particular chelating agent). Where only one type of chelate can be formed or where one is not concerned with the particular type of chelate to be formed (assuming more than one type is possible), it is often desirable to employ amounts of chelating agent in excess of the stoichiometric amount.\nAlthough we do not wish to be bound by the following theoretical structure, it is believed that the 1:1 chelate made using a tridentate chelating agent has a structure of the type represented by lithium and N,N,N',N\",N\"-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine: ##EQU2## Regardless of the number of functional groups in the chelating agent, the number of functional groups solvating the lithium at one time will never be greater than four and will usually be three. Of course, the bidentate chelating agents can have only two functional groups solvating the lithium.\nOne of the uses of the chelates of this invention is the separation and purification of the chelating agents. Thus, chelating agents may be separated and/or purified from isomeric and/or homologous non-chelating Lewis bases or other materials. The chelating agents may be purified by complexing therewith with one of the inorganic lithium salts mentioned above and the chelating agent (and the inorganic lithium salt) may then be recovered in a pure form by destabilization of the chelate which is readily accomplished by addition of polar solvents to the complex (e.g. addition of water, ethylene glycol, methanol etc.); addition of aqueous or anhydrous acids or bases (e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, etc.) or by heating at a temperature in the range of about 30\u00b0 to 250\u00b0C. For example, this technique has not only been successful in the purification of chelating agents from their crude preparations, but it can also make possible such difficult separations as between cis and trans isomers.\nThe purification and/or separation processes described above may, of course, be advantageously utilized with column and counter flow techniques, i.e. the inorganic lithium salt (complexed or uncomplexed) may be contacted with a countercurrent flow of a hydrocarbon solution of the chelating complexing agent sought to be purified and the resultant complex is then subjected to destabilization to recover the desired chelating complexing agent in a pure state.\nBy analogy, the chelating agents may be used to purify salt mixtures and indeed to synthesize desired lithium salts. Thus, the desired lithium salt may be selectively separated in a pure state from a mixture of metal salts by contacting the mixture (simple contact, column contact and counterflow contact would be suitable) with a complexing agent and thereafter destabilizing the resultant complex as described above to recover the anhydrous pure lithium salt; the complexing agent may then be recycled for further use in purification of lithium salts. Where the anion of the lithium salt is not the desired anion, the anion of the pure complexed lithium salt may be replaced for the desired anion by anionic exchange and the resultant complex is then destabilized to recover the desired lithium salt in a pure state.\nThe chelating agents of this invention are also useful in separating lithium salts from each other, present as solid (or molten) mixtures or aqueous solutions, by choosing the proper chelating agent. This is an extremely useful property of these chelating agents for there is no known prior art method for achieving such facile separations.\nIt has been discovered that the novel chealates of this invention, particularly when dissolved in an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent, afford highly conducting systems. For example, the complex of lithium aluminum hydride with N,N,N',N\", N\"-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine, when dissolved in benzene (2 molar), results in a solution having a conductivity of about 3 \u00d7 10.sup.-3 ohm/cm.\nThe high conductivity of the aromatic hydrocarbon solutions of the novel complexes renders these materials extremely useful for electrochemical reactions (e.g. dimerization of anions such as NH2 - to prepare hydrazine), as supporting electrolytes and as electrolytes in storage batteries. For example, a secondary battery may be prepared using electrodes such as platinum enclosed in a container which is insoluble in the hydrocarbon solution and utilizing the solution as charge transfer liquid. Alternatively, the battery may be made in the form of a dry cell wherein one electrode, e.g. the anode, serves as the container and the other electrode is centrally spaced from the container. Porous solution-permeable separators may be placed within the electrodes. Primary batteries may also be made using these systems in which one electrode is lithium metal or an alloy. The use of these novel complexes as electrolytes in batteries is disclosed and claimed in application Ser. No. 100,813, filed Dec. 22, 1970, entitled \"Electric Battery Using Complex Inorganic Lithium Salts and Charge Transfer Agent\" and owned by the same assignee.\nThe complexed inorganic lithium salts of this invention have also been found to be extremely useful for electrochemical purposes in a solvent-free state. It is well known that molten alkali metal salts, such as lithium iodide in the molten state, are useful as electrical conductors. However, the use of such molten salts entails special equipment and procedures since they have high melting points, e.g. LiI melts at 450\u00b0C. and LiBr melts at 547\u00b0C. However, this disadvantage can be readily overcome by complexing the lithium salt with a complexing agent such as N,N,N',N\",N\"-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDT). Crystalline LiI.PMDT complex starts to melt at about 84\u00b0C. and is completely molten at about 110\u00b0C. At 110\u00b0C., PMDT.LiBr is molten and has a conductivity of 5.2 \u00d7 10.sup.-4 (ohm-cm).sup.-1. Some lithium salts, such as lithium aluminum hydride, decompose below their melting points but complexation can extend their utility. For example, LiAlH4 decomposes at 110-125\u00b0C., whereas PMDB.LiAlH4 melts without decomposition at 150-155\u00b0C. and can be sublimed at  125\u00b0C./0.5 mm. When complexed by HMTT, LiAlH4 is stable to over 200\u00b0C.\nChelates of metal hydrides (e.g. LiAlH4, LiBH4, LiAlH3 OR, LiAlH2 X2, etc.) have been found to be superior to the uncomplexed form as reducing agents. The chelate of LiAlH4 and N,N,N',N\",N\"-pentamethyl diethylenetriamine (PMDT) is very reactive and effective in carbonyl reduction. For example, in attempting to prepare 1,2-bis-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexane from phthalic acid, the relatively cheap intermediate, hexahydrophthalic anhydride, was reduced to the corresponding dihydroxy compound with the conventional LiAlH4 -in-ether only with great difficulty and with relatively poor yield. It was therefore necessary to first hydrogenate diethyl phthalate to the corresponding hexahydro ester and thereafter reduce this ester to the dihydroxy compound. However, by using the LiAlH4. PMDT chelate in benzene, the cheap hexahydrophthalic anhydride was reduced to the dihydroxy compound with an 80% yield of 96% pure material thereby saving costs of raw materials and one process step. The chelated metal hydrides are also very useful in reducing esters, ketones, aldehydes, imines, oximes, hydrazones, amides, sulfoxides, nitriles, isonitriles, alkyl sulfones (which are generally not reduced by the uncomplexed metal hydrides in ether) nitro compounds, carboxylic acids, anhydrides, \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carboxyls, or other inorganic compounds, etc.\nChelation of lithium aluminum hydride and lithium borohydride also provides a new process for separating and purifying these types of compounds from their extensive impurities in commercial products. The process comprises the following steps: (a) contacting the impure complex hydride with a chelating agent, selected from the group tertiary polyamines and tertiary aminoethers, in the presence of a solvent for the chelate, and (b) separating the soluble chelated complex hydride from the insoluble impurities. It is preferred to use the pure chelate solution directly as prepared, but the pure chelates may be isolated as crystalline complexes or, in some cases, dissociated to recover the pure complex hydride separately from the chelating agent.\nSuitable solvents for the chelates include aromatic hydrocarbons, pyridine, monohalogenated benzenes, alkylated benzenes, N,N-dialkylanilines and mixtures thereof including mixtures with minor amounts of saturated hydrocarbon solvents. Saturated hydrocarbon solvents may be used in a few instances, but they are generally not satisfactory. Most preferred solvents are aromatic hydrocarbons and their lower alkyl derivatives, especially benzene.\nThe chelated lithium compounds may be utilized in addition reactions: ##EQU3##\nAs a outgrowth of this invention, it has been found possible to prepare novel chelated lithio radical anions.\nThese novel lithio radical anions may be prepared by two methods. In the first method, a lithium dispersion and a chelating agent are admixed with an aromatic or heterocyclic aromatic compound whose reduction potential is greater than that of biphenyl (i.e., greater than -2.70 volts in a more positive sense vs. a saturated calomel electrode and therefore will accept an electron more readily than biphenyl) (e.g. naphthalene, anthracene, biphenyl, azulene, pyracene, pyrazine benzofuran, benzo[B]thiophene, 4,4'-bipyridyl, cyano and nitrosubstituted benzenes, pyridazine, perinaphthalene, pyrene, phenanthrene, indene, isoindene, isobenzofuran, quinoline, isoquinoline, cinnoline, naphthyridine, pyrido [3,4-b] pyridine, anthranil, xanthene, acridine, dibenzothiophene, dibenzofuran, triphenylene, chrysene, 1,2-dibenzopyrene, 1,2,5,6-dibenzanthracene, coronene, fluoroanthene, acenaphthylene, tetracene, dibiphenylene-ethane, [2,2]paracyclophane, etc. as well as alkyl, cycloalkyl, cyano and nitro derivatives thereof). Depending on the particular aromatic compound of choice, a complexed mono- or di-lithio radical anion is formed; the general structure of such an anion is as follows:\n\n [Chelating Agent.Li].sup.+ [Ar]\u2250\nThe second method involves the admixture of lithium metal and a chelating agent containing an aromatic nucleus; this chelating agent may be used as is or dissolved in a hydrocarbon. By this method, novel lithio radical anions having the following general structures may be prepared: ##SPC1##\nIn the general formulas above, the rings may contain substituents and R is a hydrocarbon (e.g. alkyl) radical of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably a C1 to C4 alkyl radical. It should also be understood that the multi-ring analogs (anthracene, phenanthrene, etc.) and heterocyclic aromatics, such as quinoline, as well as the alkaryl or aralkyl analogs of these chelating aromatic-tert.-diamines may be used.\nThe novel complexed lithio radical anions are useful as catalysts, as electrochemical media, in batteries, as reducing agents, additives and in syntheses. This invention is illustrated by the following examples:\nEXAMPLE 1\nTo 30 ml of a 1 molar solution of pentamethyldiethylenetriamine.LiAlH4 (PMDT.LiAlH4) in benzene was added dropwise 1.38 g (30 mmoles) of absolute ethanol in benzene. The reaction mixture was filtered removing 0.42 g of solid and the filtrate was allowed to evaporate under a nitrogen atmosphere and crystals grew. These were recovered and analyzed; theory for PMDT.LiAlH3 OC2 H5 ; C, 51.74%; H, 12.24%; N, 16.46%. Found C, 50.85%; H, 10.72%; N, 16.63%. The NMR spectrum of the product in benzene was also consistent with that expected for PMDT.LiAlH3 OC2 H5.\nEXAMPLE 2\nTo a solution of 3.1 g (20 mmoles) of tetramethylethylenediamine.LiAlH4 (TMED.LiAlH4) in 100 ml of benzene was added a solution of 4.61 g (20 mmoles) of tris-(\u03b2-di-methylaminoethyl) amine (iso-HMTT) in 20 ml of benzene with stirring. The mixture was filtered and the residue was dried, wt. 3.36 g. A portion of the product was recrystallized from benzene and analyzed: theory for iso-HMTT.LiAlH4 C, 53.71%; H, 12.77%; N, 20.88%. Found C, 52.26%; H, 12.84%, N, 21.29%.\nEXAMPLE 3\nTo 10 mmoles of PMDT.LiAlH4 in 40 ml of benzene was added 2.93 g (40 mmoles) of diethylamine in 40 ml of benzene. The reaction mixture was stirred 3 days, concentrated, diluted with heptane and allowed to stand under a nitrogen atmosphere whereupon rod-like crystals deposited. The latter were isolated by filtration and dried. The NMR spectrum of the product in benzene showed a ratio of three dimethylamino groups to one PMDT and when water was added to the benzene solution H2 gas was evolved. Thus the product was PMDT.LiAlH [(N(C2 H5)2 ]3. Analysis: theory for PMDT.LiAlH[N(C2 H5)2 ]3 C, 59.41%; H, 12.82%; N, 19.79%. Found C, 58.54%; H, 12.53% N, 19.05%.\nEXAMPLE 4\nTo 16.8 mmoles of PMDT.LiCl in 20 ml of benzene was added a solution of 1.92 g (16.8 mmoles) of Al(C2 H5)3 in 20 ml of benzene. NMR analysis of the solution showed that the product was PMDT.LiAlCl(C2 H5)3.\nEXAMPLE 5\nTo a solution of 2.60 g (10 mmole) PMDT.LiBr in 50 ml of benzene was added 10 ml of a 1 molar solution of Al(n-C3 H7)3 in heptane. NMR analysis of the solution showed that the product was PMDT.LiAlBr(n-C3 H7)3.\nEXAMPLE 6\nTo 15 mmoles of iso-HMTT.LiN(CH3)2 in 75 ml of benzene was added 15 ml of a 1 molar solution of Al(n-C3 H7)3 in heptane. The solvents were stripped from the reaction mixture and the product, wt. 6.6 g, was analyzed by NMR. The spectrum was consistent with that expected for iso-HMTT. LiAl(n-C3 H7)3 N(CH3)2.\nEXAMPLE 7\nCombination of iso-HMTT.LiN(CH3)2 with one equivalent of Al(C2 H5)2 N(C2 H5)2 as described in Example 6 gave iso-HMTT. LiAl(C2 H5)2 N(CH3)2 N(C2 H5)2 by NMR Analysis.\nEXAMPLE 8\nSet forth in Table I are the thermal stabilities and benzene solubilities at room temperature of several crystalline complexes. These data indicate that the complexes have different stabilities and solubilities. Thus, lithium salts can be separated from one another and from other metal salts, and complexing agents may be separated from one another and from other materials. The purified lithium salts and complexing agents can be readily recovered by merely heating the complex alone or in solution at preferably above its decomposition temperature (the lithium salt starts to precipitate out at such temperatures); such destabilization heating may also be advantageously accomplished in the presence of a hydrocarbon which will solubilize the complexing agent, but not the complex or the lithium salt. Although quantitative recovery (by heating or other destabilization techniques) of the lithium salt and complexing agent is not possible in a single batch operation (because of equilibria of the destabilization reaction), a cyclic process can (and should) be used if quantitative recovery is desired.\n\n               TABLE I______________________________________             Decomposition   SolubilityLithium  Complexing Temp., \u00b0C.                             in BenzeneSalt   Agent      (at\u02dc0.5 mm Hg)                             (molar)______________________________________LiCl   trans-     29              0.5  TMCHDLiBr   trans-     125             0.8  TMCHDLiI    trans-     203             0.3  TMCHDLiBr   cis-TMCHD  80              \u02dc0.1LiI    TM-o-PD    97              0.4LiBr   TMED       50-100          1.6LiNO.sub.3  TMED       --              0.3LiAlH.sub.4  TMED       125(at 1.3 mm).sup.(a)                             0.82LiBH.sub.4  TMED       --              1.0LiAlH.sub.4  2 TMED     --.sup.(b)      0.172 LiBr HMTT       \u02dc143      \u02dc0.1LiBr   HMTT       \u02dc40       \u02dc0.3LiNO.sub.3  HMTT       --              >2.0.sup.(j)LiBH.sub.4  HMTT       --              3.0LiAlH.sub.4  HMTT       >200.sup.(c)    0.005LiBF.sub.4  HMTT       --              1.33 LiI  HMCHT      60              >0.1LiAlH.sub.4  TM-o-PDA   --              1.01LiCl   PMDT       70              2.5LiBr   PMDT       86.sup.(d)      2.5LiI    PMDT       sublimes.sup.(e)                             2.5LiNO.sub.3  PMDT       --              2.66LiBH.sub.4  PMDT       75 (at 1 mm).sup.(f)                             forms gel.sup.(i)LiAlH.sub.4  PMDT       --.sup.(g)      1.8LiBF.sub.4  PMDT       --.sup.(h)      0.19LiPF.sub.6  PMDT       --              1.25LiB    PMDT       --              0.04(C.sub.6 H.sub.5).sub.4LiNO.sub.2  iso-HMTT   --              >1.0LiCl   n-HMTP(k)  100-105         >2.0______________________________________ .sup.(a) blackens above 176\u00b0C. .sup.(b) M.P. 118-120\u00b0C. .sup.(c) stable to 200\u00b0C.; M.P. >200\u00b0C. .sup.(d) M.P. 92-93.5\u00b0C. .sup.(e) M.P. 89-110\u00b0C. .sup.(f) M.P. 74-81\u00b0C. .sup.(g) sublimes w/o decomp. at 125\u00b0C./0.5 mm; M.P. 150-155\u00b0C. .sup.(h) M.P. 118-121\u00b0C. .sup.(i) Solubility greater than 3 molar at 25\u00b0C. .sup.(j) HMTT.LiNO.sub.3 is a liquid at 25\u00b0C. .sup.(k) N,N,N',N\",N'\", N\"\", N\"\" --heptamethyltetraethylenepentamine.\nEXAMPLE 9\nTo 6 mmoles of PMDT.LiAlH4 in benzene was added 3.57 g (12 mmoles) of HN(n-C10 H21)2.

The reaction mixture was stirred overnight, concentrated and analyzed by NMR. The product was PMDT.LiAlH3 SC8 H17, wt. 5.4 g.\nEXAMPLE 13\nLithium aluminum hydrate, 0.37 g. (19 mmole) was mixed with 1.44 g. (10 mmole) of N,N.N',N'-tetramethyl-1,4-butanediamine (TMBD). The resulting paste was stirred for 18 hours then diluted with 6 ml. benzene and filtered. The insoluble complex weighed 1.40 g. and upon evaporation of 2 g. of the filtrate, an additional 0.05 g. of white solid was obtained, thus indicating that LiAlH4.TMBD has some solubility in benzene.\nLiAlH4, 3.80 g. (100 mmole) was dispersed in 50 ml. of benzene and 11.62 g. (100 mmole) of TMED were added. The mixture was diluted to 100 ml. of benzene, stirred at room temperature for hours and filtered. A grey residue of 0.22 g. (5.8% of the starting LiAlH4) was removed and the clear, colorless filtrate was allowed to evaporate under nitrogen. A white crystalline solid was isolated by filtration and the mother liquor was allowed to evaporate further and a second and third crop of crystals were isolated. A total quantity of 9.0 g. of 1:1 complex of LiAlH4 and TMED was obtained.\nTo a 25 ml. portion of 0.75 molar solution of LiAlH4. TMED in benzene was added dropwise an additional 2.18 g. (18.75 mmole) of TMED with stirring. A white precipitate (4.28 g.) was isolated by filtration of the mixture. This solid, upon analysis, indicated that a 1:2 complex of LiAlH4 and TMED was formed. Thus, LiAlH4 and TMED can form two distinct compositions of matter: LiAlH4.TMED and LiAlH4.2 TMED.\nUsing the procedure described above, the crystalline complex LiAlH4.PMDT and the crystalline complex LiAlH4.HMTT were prepared. The former was found to be so highly soluble in pure benzene that it was found that as a preferred procedure for obtaining the crystalline complex LiAlH4.PMDT, it was desirable to add heptane to the solution (whereupon it split into two liquid phases) and allow crystals to grow from the resultant two phase mixture by solvent evaporation. The crystalline complex LiAlH4.HMTT was prepared by complexing agent exchange from both LiAlH4.PMDT and LiAlH4.TMED by addition of HMTT to benzene solutions of the complexes. LiAlH4.HMTT precipitated in nearly quantitative yield.\nLiBH4.PMDT was prepared by the method described for the preparation of LiAlH4.PMDT and LiBH4.HMTT was prepared from LiBH4 and HMTT. The complexing agent exchange was not used to prepare the latter complex since LiBH4.HMTT is very soluble in benzene in contrast to LiAlH4.HMTT.\nThe results of this example are summarized in Table II below.\n\n                                   TABLE II__________________________________________________________________________Lithium Salt,     Complexing Agent               Isolated                     Complex Analysisg.

This is because LiAlH4 follows C2 V symmetry which predicts at least two Al--H stretching frequencies and indicates considerable H--Li--H interaction approaching a 3 center-2 electron bond (Figure A) resulting in a rather covalent compound. LiAlH4.PMDT in Nujol has only one Al--H stretch at 1690 cm..sup.-1. This can only occur if the AlH4 anion now follows Td symmetry selection rules which predict only one infrared active Al--H stretch. Thus, the AlH4 anion in the complex is tetrahedral and the complex is more ionic as the H--Li--H interaction has been removed (Figure B). The substance is now a cation solvated contact ion pair. ##EQU4##\nThe significance of these findings is that in LiAlH4. PMDT (and LiAlH4.HMTT), the AlH4 anion is fundamentally different from that of uncomplexed LiAlH4. The anion is a free AlH4 anion in a contact ion pair rather than part of a covalent molecule. Associated with such changes in the structure are increased reactivity, such as in reductions, and increased conductivity. The same infrared spectral changes have been found for LiBH4 vs. LiBH4.HMTT. Differences in the infrared spectrum of the anion of Lithium-Anion vss. Lithium-Anion.Complexing Agent are direct evidence for the complexes being distinct compositions of matter having unique properties and not solutions or mixtures of a salt and a complexing agent.\nBy using these techniques, impure commercial LiAlH4 and LiBH4 may be easily purified of associated contaminants as the latter do not pass into benzene solution in the presence of these complexing agents. Filtration of the mixture followed by evaporation of the solvent, destabilization of the complex and removal of the complexing agent would afford extremely pure LiAlH4 or LiBH4. Alternatively, the pure hydrides could be precipitated from solution by heating or by addition of another substance which complexes more strongly with the complexing agent than do the hydrides. Preferably, the complexes are utilized directly in the solvents in which they are prepared.\nEXAMPLE 14\n3.35 g. (25 mmole) of LiI was dispersed in 50 ml. of benzene and 5.88 g. (25 mmole) of N'-phenyl-N,N,N\",N\"-tetramethyldiethylenetriamine (N'-\u03c6-TMDT) was added with stirring and after 18 hours the mixture was filtered. The fine, white solid residue weighed 2.74 g. and the filtrate deposited colorless cyrstals when allowed to partially evaporate. The solid residue analyzed as a 1:1 chelate of N'-\u03c6-TMDT and LiI.\nIn a similar manner N'-\u03c6-TMDT.LiAlH4 was prepared and the data are summarized in Table III. Therefore, the chelating agent of an inorganic lithium salt chelate may have an aryl group attached to a nitrogen atom as well as alkyl groups.\n\n                                   TABLE III__________________________________________________________________________Chelating Agent, g.

(25 mmole) of LiAlH4 was dispersed in 25 ml. of benzene and 2.55 g. (25 mmole) of tetramethylmethane diamine (TMMD) was added with stirring. After 18 hours, stirring was stopped, the reaction mixture was allowed to settle and 2 g. of the clear liquid phase was transferred to a watch glass and allowed to evaporate. A white crystalline residue, wt. 0.1 g. remained which reacted vigorously with water evolving gas.\n0.95 g. (25 mmole) of LiAlH4 was dispersed in 10 ml. of benzene, 5.11 g. of TMMD (50 mmole) was added, the mixture was diluted to 24 ml. and stirred for 20 hours. The reaction mixture was filtered and a gray solid residue, wt. 0.35 g., remained on the filter disc (ASTM-10-15). The clear colorless filtrate afforded white crystals upon partial evaporation which evolved hydrogen gas when hydrolyzed. Therefore, an excess of the complexing agent gives a greater amount of LiAlH4 complex in solution.\nThe above data demonstrate that inorganic lithium salts and ditertiary amines in which both nitrogens atoms are on the same carbon atom can form complexes which may be hydrocarbon soluble.\nEXAMPLE 16\nTo 210 ml. of 1.0 M LiAlH4.PMDT (0.21 mole in benzene) was added dropwise a solution of 45.5 g. diethyl hexahydrophthalate. A vigorous reaction occurred and the flask was cooled to maintain the temperature at 30\u00b0-40\u00b0C. After addition, the reaction mixture (pasty) was refluxed for about 3 hours. The mixture was cooled and hydrolyzed with 10% hydrochloric acid. The benzene solution was separated and the aqueous phase was washed with three 200 ml. portions of ether. The combined benzene solution and ether extracts were washed with water and sodium bicarbonate solution and dried over anhydrous Na2 SO4.\nThe solution was filtered and ether-benzene was stripped off. The residue was simply distilled under reduced pressure. A product was collected (b.p. 123-125\u00b0C. at 0.5 mm, wt. 17.0 g.) which solidified on standing. Residue = 3.2 g.\nInfra-red analysis showed a broad OH band at about 3300 cm.- 1 and no carbonyl band at 1740 cm.- 1. G.C. analysis showed product to be 93% pure trans-1,2-cyclohexanedimethanol.\nA number of additional runs were made using benzene solutions of PMDT in various mole ratios to LiAlH4, TMED as the chelating agent and hexahydrophthalic anhydride instead of diethyl hexahydrophthalate as the substance to be reduced. The data from these experiments are summarized in Table IV. Reaction times varied from two to 18 hours, but even a reaction time of 2 hours is probably unnecessary. Reduction appeared to be complete within minutes.\nIn contrast to the results summarized in Table IV. reduction of diethyl hexahydrophthalate or hexahydrophthalic anhydride with excess LiAlH4 by conventional procedures in ether solvents gave impure glycol in very low yield only after extended reaction times.\nClearly, chelated LiAlH4 in benzene is a far superior reducing agent to LiAlH4 in ether solvents. Yields are higher incomplete reductions are avoided and reaction times are an order of magnitude or more shorter.\nEXAMPLE 17\nTo 15 mmoles of PMDT.LiAlH4 in 60 ml. of benzene was added 1.65 g. (15 mmoles) of C6 H5 SH. Vigorous gas evolution occurred and the resulting solution was allowed to evaporate under a nitrogen atmosphere until crystals deposited. The latter were recovered by filtration, wt. 2.8 g., washed with pentane, dried and analyzed.\n\n                                   TABLE IV__________________________________________________________________________   Chelating Agent         Compound      Yield of   and Mole Ratio        Reaction              Chel.LiAlH.sub.4                      Reduced       Distilled                                           % PurityRun   to LiAlH.sub.4        Time, hrs.

One-half of this solution was transferred under nitrogen to a 100 ml. flask which contained 0.64 g. of lithium shavings. After 1 hour a dark green solution of the radical ion chelate was obtained. After ca. 45 hours a 5 ml. aliquot of this reaction mixture was diluted to 50 ml. and about 1 ml. of this solution was placed in a dry 4 mm O.D. pyrex glass sample tube for esr analysis.

The chelated radical anion was DPYE\u2022Li+C 10 H8\u2250 .\nEXAMPLE 24\n1,2-Dipyrrolidylethane (3.36 g., 20 mmole), lithium bromide (1.74 g., 20 mmole), and 75 ml. of benzene were combined and stirred overnight. The mixture was filtered and the residue was vacuum dried for 1 hour to give 3.0 g. of white solid complex. Elemental analysis (C, H, and N) suggested a composition containing a 1 to 1.5 ratio of DPYE to LiBr.\nEXAMPLE 25\nTerphenyl (3.465 g., 15 mmole), PMDT (2.595 g., 15 mmole), lithium dispersion (0.075 g.) and 20 ml. of benzene were combined. After stirring overnight the thick green suspension was filtered to give 4.7 g. of the green solid radical anion PMDT.Li+[\u03a9-\u03a9-\u03a9]\u2250.\nEXAMPLE 26\nA 1.29 g. (5 mmoles) portion of Al(C6 H5)3 was mixed with 100 ml. of benzene and the mixture was heated to 70\u00b0C. with stirring. To the clear solution was added 1.30 g. (5 mmoles) of PMDT.LiBr in 65 ml. of benzene and the mixture was stirred at 70\u00b0C. for 2 hours, cooled to room temperature and filtered, removing 0.08 g. of solid. The filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure and the product, wt. 2.6 g., was analyzed by NMR in C6 D6 and was found to be PMDT.LiAl(C6 H5)3 Br.\nWhile the above examples illustrate the invention in great detail, it should be understood that the present invention in its broadest aspects is not necessarily limited to the specific materials, conditions and procedures shown therein.

No. 215,149, filed Jan. 3, 1972 now abandoned.\nThe present invention relates to catalytic structures and methods of forming the same, being more particularly directed to high-surface-area palladium adsorbed onto a substrate, with and without similarly adsorbed gold, and methods of preparing the same, useful for electrochemical cell electrode and similar uses, oxidation processes, and other well-known similar uses, all hereinafter generically embraced by the terms \"catalytic\" or \"catalyst.\"\nThe use of palladium as an electrochemical catalytic electrode, such as a fuel cell anode or the like, has been well known, as described, for example, in \"A Hydrocarbon-Air Fuel Cell with Molten Alkali-Hydroxide Electrolyte\" Walter Juda, Henry G. Petrow, Robert L. Novak, Robert J. Allen, David M. Moulton et al., Proceedings of the Electrochemical Society, October, 1968, Montreal, Canada, p. 183, paper 353, wherein use is made of the hydrogen-gas-pervious properties of solid layers or sheets of palladium. The problems of providing porous catalytic palladium structures, such as electrodes for fuel cells or the like, however, have involved difficulties in the production of large surface areas and of tenacious deposits upon appropriate substrates; and it is more particularly to these problems that the present invention, in one of its important aspects, is directed. It has been extremely difficult, for example, to deposit palladium in extremely fine and strongly adherent particles to create a large surface area structure. In addition, palladium has been known unsatisfactorily to corrode in fuel cell operation and the like upon loss of protective hydrogen fuel.\nIt is an object of the invention, accordingly, to provide a new and improved high-surface-area palladium catalytic structure strongly adsorbed upon appropriate rough or porous substrate and resistant to corrosive influences, and to provide novel methods of forming the same.\nAnother object is to provide a novel combined palladium and gold catalytic structure and method useful for fuel cell oxidation, and other catalytic applications.\nA further object is to provide such novel structures of more general catalytic usage, as well.\nStill another object is to provide new methods of preparation of sols from which such structures may be made.\nOther and further objects will be explained hereinafter and are more particularly defined in the appended claims. In summary, however, from one of its broader aspects, the invention contemplates palladium particles (in some instances combined with similar gold particles) of substantially 20-40 Angstroms particle size adsorbed to an appropriate substrate, preferably by the reduction of a NO2 -free and chloride-free palladium oxide colloid sol. Preferred details are hereinafter explained.\nReferring first to the illustrative application to electrochemical cell operation (though the invention is of broader utility, as previously and hereinafter explained), porous catalytic electrodes have important application as anode structures in phosphoric acid fuel cells and other cells, as of the type described in \"A High-Performance Fuel Cell Employing Conduction-PorousTeflon Electrodes and Liquid Electrolytes,\" L. W. Niedrach et al, Journal of Electrochemical Society, Vol. 112, Feb., 1965, p. 117-124. In such cells, carbon monoxide, produced when natural gas or other hydrocarbons are reformed to make the hydrogen fuel, is known to poison catalytic anode surfaces; and organics and other corrosive materials from the various cell components have similarly deleteriously affected the electrode life.\nIn accordance with a discovery underlying the present invention, it has been found that if small palladium particles in the approximately 20-40 Angstrom particle size range can be strongly adhered to a porous carbon or similar rough substrate, not only is an extremely high surface area palladium catalytic anode provided, but the small particulate form is remarkably tolerant to both carbon monoxide and such organics and corrosive materials from the cell components. More than this, a remarkable resistance to corrosion, even if the protection of the hydrogen fuel is lost and even at temperatures up to 160\u00b0C, over a substantial period of time, has surprisingly been found to be produced by such structures, contrary to the experience with prior palladium electrodes.\nIt is perhaps first in order to describe how the palladium catalytic structure is preferably formed.\nPalladium metal, which is normally difficultly soluble in concentrated nitric acid, has been found to be violently dissolvable upon the adding to the nitric acid of a trace of bromine ions, such as through HBr. While palladium could have been dissolved in aqua regia, the stability of the colloidal sol of the invention (from which the particulated palladium is adsorbed upon the porous or rough substrate) requires absence of chloride ions. Since residual NO2 is also undesirable, the nitric acid that has dissolved the palladium is reflux-boiled to remove all traces of NO2 and to concentrate the solution. The concentrated solution is then diluted with water and contacted with a water-immiscible highmolecular weight amine, such as the tertiary octyl amine Alamine 336 of General Mills Chemical Company, to bring the pH of the aqueous phase to about 3.0. The aqueous palladium oxide, with some palladium oxide precipitate, is separated and filtered to remove such precipitate. It has been determined by the O'Connor technique (described at \"Fabrication of Monodisperse Lucite and Iron Oxide Particles With A Spinning Disc Generator,\" R. E. Albert, Henry G. Petrow et al, Health Physics, Vol. 10, pp. 933-940, 1964) that the resulting colloidal particles of the intensely brown palladium oxide in this sol are substantially in the 20-40 Angstrom particle size range. This sol is adsorbed upon a suitable substrate, such as porous carbon for electrode application (for example, Norit A high-surface area carbon black), and is reduced, as with hydrazine, to yield palladium metal particles of substantially the same size range, tenaciously adsorbed on the substrate.\nAn example follows of the efficacy of a catalytic structure so prepared and used as a porous hydrogen anode, one inch square, in a 135\u00b0C phosphoric acid fuel cell employing a similarly dimensional platinum air cathode. The Norit A carbon substrate anode containing the adsorbed palladium particles above-discussed in a loading of about 1/2 milligram/cm2, was found to be remarkably tolerant to CO in the hydrogen fuel, providing only about 20 millivolt drop in cell voltage at 100 amperes per square foot current in operation when as much as 1.6 percent (by volume) of CO was present in the hydrogen fuel, reformed from natural gas, and as compared with pure hydrogen fuel operation. No significant decay with time was noted.\nIt was found that if an equivalent amount of platinum (by cost) were used on the anode and operated under the same conditions, an initial 200 millivolts of loss caused by CO poisoning is rapidly produced, with as much as another 100 millivolts being lost over time because of platinum poisoning from the organics, etc., of the cell components.\nAnd even if the platinum and palladium loading of the equivalent catalytic anodes is made exactly the same and the cell is operated under the same conditions, the platinum anode, as distinguished from the palladium anode of the invention, produced a large 30-50 millivolts initial CO-poisoning loss, which increased with time, the operational characteristics decaying in performance.\nMore than this, despite prior experience in the art with the highly corrosive action of phosphoric acid, under heat, upon palladium that is not protected by a hydrogen layer, it has been surprisingly found that the particulate form of palladium anode above-described exhibits unusual properties. Whereas the prior art considered it necessary to alloy the palladium with, for example, gold to prevent this corrosion, and the resulting poorer catalytic activity of such alloying had to be put up with, this is not required with the structure of the invention for this particular purpose, though, as later explained, the combined use of gold may also be desirable. If the fuel cell is continued \"on load\" but the hydrogen fuel is lost, for example, it has been discovered that the catalytic particulate palladium anode structures of the invention still resists the phosphoric acid, such that the cell only suffers about 5 millivolts of loss of performance over even as much as an hour of continued operation. If the output circuit is opened, moreover, and the hydrogen fuel input is again lost, it has been found that no detectable loss in cell performance occurs even after 24 hours of such operation; again attesting to the unusual properties of the catalytic structure of the invention.\nAnother important catalytic application of the particulated palladium-adsorbed substrate of the invention, enabling far less costly structures than if platinum had to be used, resides, for example, in its use on rough insulating asbestos or the like and on conductive metal strips or screen substrate, etc., to oxidize solvents in commercial processes, such as methyl ethyl ketone and the like, or to oxidize grease from cooking or other high-temperature solvent, carbon or similar effluents.\nIn connection with the use of the structures of the invention as oxidation process catalysts, typical results include the following. Using high surface area alumina pellets as a substrate, catalysts of identical palladium content were prepared; in one case, by adsorbing the palladium oxide sol of the invention on the pellets, and in the other case, by adsorbing a solution of palladium nitrate onto the pellets. The oxidation catalyst performance was then compared for the air oxidation of methane and benzene. For such catalysts containing 0.1% by weight of palladium, the catalyst prepared from the sol of the invention produced ignition temperatures for benzene approximately 30\u00b0C lower than those obtained using the catalyst prepared from palladium nitrate. In the case of the oxidation of methane the catalyst prepared from the sol of the invention was superior in ignition temperatures by about 40\u00b0C.\nIt has been found, furthermore, that the simultaneous use of both the colloidal palladium and colloidal gold, both in the oxide form, provides even a greater measure of performance, particularly as hydrogen anode or other electrode structures in the before mentioned fuel cells and the like.\nIn a fuel cell as before-described, operating with a hydrogen fuel containing carbon monoxide, (such as 80% hydrogen, 1.6% carbon monoxide, with the remainder being carbon dioxide) and with a loading of palladium adsorbed on carbon of 0.5 milligram per square centimeter, typical performance at 135\u00b0C with a platinum cathode produces about 100 asf (amperes per square foot) at approximately 670 millivolts. If, however, gold is added in the colloidal form before-mentioned, to the catalyst structure in a substantially equal amount to that of palladium present, namely, about 0.5 milligram per square centimeter, typical performance at 135\u00b0C and at 100 asf will be considerably increased to the order of 730 millivolts. This improvement becomes even more apparent for high current densities. For example, at 500 asf, the gold-palladium mixture of the invention is superior to palladium alone by about 100 millivolts. This, in turn, is superior to platinum by about 250 millivolts, when the platinum loading is .25 milligrams per square centimeter, the equivalent in cost to the one milligram total gold and palladium loading; and the gold-palladium mixture is far more suitable than platinum at the higher current densities where much more deterioration in performance of the latter was noted.\nFor example, one such fuel cell was operated for over 3200 hours without the gold-palladium anode of the invention showing any detectable deterioriation whatsoever.\nThe gold oxide colloidal particles in this mixture are of the same size range as the before-described palladium particles; and it has been found, as before explained, that to be effective as described, the gold must be applied to the substrate in this colloidal oxide form. Where, indeed, the gold was merely adsorbed on the carbon substrate from either chloroauric acid or sodium chloroaurate, the performance in the presence of palladium was identical to anodes prepared from palladium containing no gold whatsoever. The surprising result of the marked enhancement derived from the use of colloidal gold as above-described, moreover, resides further in the fact that, when applied as such a gold colloid, the gold itself appears to exhibit no anode activity whatsoever in the phosphoric acid electrolyte of the cell. furthermore X-ray diffraction studies demonstrate that there is no alloy formation from co-mingling of gold and palladium.\nThe colloidal gold oxide of the invention is preferably prepared and applied as follows. Two thousandths of a mol of chloroauric acid is dissolved in about 900 cc of water. To this is added 0.008 mol sodium hydroxide, as one molar sodium hydroxide solution, while stirring. The mixture is then allowed to stand approximately 48 hours during which period the solution changes color from bright yellow to a clear wine-red colloidal dispersion of gold oxide, exhibiting typical properties of colloids, such as flocculation upon prolonged heating or the addition of strong electrolyte such as sodium nitrate.\nIf the before-mentioned type of high surface carbon substrate such as Norit A, is employed, the colloidal gold is added thereto typically in the ratio of 50 grams of Norit A for 4 grams of colloidal gold. Following adsorption of the gold, the mixture is filtered, washed and redispersed in water. Sufficient colloidal palladium oxide sol (of typical concentration 5 grams palladium per liter) is then added to provide a total of about 4 grams of palladium particles adsorbed by the Norit A. This mixture is then reduced with hydrazine to yield gold and palladium metals; and the product is then filtered, washed and dried at 150\u00b0C, being then usable as the catalytic material for forming the electrode, with the improved results before recounted.\nFurther uses and modifications will also occur to those skilled in this art, and all such are considered to fall within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.\n", "claims": "\nWhat is claimed is:\n \n1.

The surfaces of the interstitial crevices are provided with a coating of cobalt metal to enhance the retention of the molten lithium metal within the substrate.", "background": "\nCONTRACTUAL ORIGIN OF THE INVENTION\nThe invention described herein was made in the course of, or under, a contract with the UNITED STATES ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION.\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\nThis invention relates to secondary electrochemical, power-producing cells that are capable of providing high current densities, high capacity densities and long cycle lives. In more detail, the invention relates to a high-temperature cell that employs molten lithium metal as an anode reactant and a chalcogen such as sulfur or a metallic sulfide as the cathode reactant. The cell includes an improved anode (negative electrode) that exhibits good retention of molten lithium metal during cycling.\nA substantial amount of work has been done in the development of electrochemical cells for applications requiring a high specific energy (watt hours per kilogram; W-hr/kg) and a long cycle life (number of charge/discharge cycles before failure). One such application is a battery power source for an electrically powered vehicle. For such an application, the high specific energy requirement must be achieved without sacrificing peak specific power (watts per kilogram; W/kg). Depending upon the design and materials of an electric passenger vehicle, a range approaching 200 miles and an acceptable acceleration capability would require a battery having a specific energy of at least 200 W-hr/kg and a specific power of at least 200 W/kg.\nOne class of cells that show promise for development of high-specific-energy, high-specific-power secondary batteries are those that operate at elevated temperatures with molten electrolyte. These cells employ lithium or sodium anodes and cathode materials of group VI or VII of the periodic table, the chalcogens and halogens. Of these cells, the lithium/sulfur cell having electrolyte containing lithium ions has proven to be very promising. Examples of such cells are given in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,827,910 to Cairns et al., entitled \"Homogeneous Cathodoe Mixtures for Secondary Electrochemical Power Producing Cells\", Aug. 6, 1974, and 3,716,409 to Cairns et al., entitled \"Cathodes for Secondary Electrochemical Power Producing Cells\", Feb. 13, 1973; both assigned to the assignee of the present application.\nIn some cells the positive electrode employs a metallic sulfide as opposed to elemental sulfur as the reactant. Such cells are illustrated in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 434,459, filed Jan. 18, 1974, entitled \"Cathode for a Secondary Electrochemical Cell\", to Gay et al. In addition, various types of anode materials such as lithium-aluminum alloy and molten mixtures of lithium and other metallic additives have been investigated in attempts to achieve stability of the anode with cycling.\nIn order to maximize both specific energy and specific power of a given electrochemical cell, elemental lithium is a preferred choice for an anode reactant material due to its extremely low electronegativity and low equivalent weight. However, substantial problems have arisen in providing an anode structure or substrate capable of retaining lithium metal charge with cycling. One material that has proven reasonably successful as an anode substrate and current collector is a porous stainless steel matrix having about 80 to 90% void volume and about 65 to 70 microns average pore size. This material can be composed of a random array of stainless steel fibers compressed in a random fashion and sintered at high temperatures, thereby creating a porous metal. Stainless steel Feltmetal (a trademark) is a commonly available material that has been employed with some success as a porous substrate for retaining molten lithium metal in electrochemical cells.\nA continuing effort is being carried out to find improved anode substrate materials. High current densities (mA/cm2) are necessary to achieve high power densities. At current densities of about 200 mA/cm2 and above, which probably will be required for acceptable operation of an electric vehicle for personal and family transportation, the problem of lithium loss from the anode is intensified. In the continuing search for improved materials and components that will meet these problems, it is also desirable that less complex and more inexpensive materials be found to provide a power source for an electric vehicle that is economically attractive.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nIt is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved anode structure for use in a high-temperature secondary electrochemical cell.\nIt is a further object to provide an anode structure having improved lithium retention characteristics at high current densities.\nIt is also an object of this invention to provide a method of preparing an anode including molten lithium metal that can be used with reduced lithium loss within a high-temperature secondary electrochemical cell.\nIn accordance with the present invention, an improved anode is presented for use within a secondary electrochemical cell at high temperatures. The cell also includes a cathode containing a chalcogen material, such as sulfur or a sulfur compound, and a molten electrolyte between the two electrodes. The anode comprises a porous base structure with a cobalt coating over surfaces of open interstitial crevices. Molten lithium metal is sorbed within the porous base structure and exhibits good retention with cycling due to contact between the molten lithium and the cobalt coating.\nThe improved anode is prepared by cleaning a mass of metallic wool that is made up of randomly entangled metallic fibers. The cobalt metal coating is deposited onto these fibers while they are in a loosely structured or expanded condition to insure coating of all surfaces. The coated metallic wool is then compacted into a porous substrate and impregnated by soaking within molten lithium metal.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\nThe present invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein\nFIG. 1 is an elevation view in cross section of an experimental cell used to demonstrate the present invention.\nFIG. 2 is a graph of capacity in amp-hours v the charge/discharge cycles for the two laboratory cells described in Example I.\nFIG. 3 is a graph showing capacity density in amp-hrs/cm2 and the coulombic efficiency v charge/discharge cycle for the electrochemical cell described in Example II.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT\nReferring now to FIG. 1 where an electrochemical cell is illustrated having a housing 11 containing a cathode (positive electrode) 13, an anode (negative electrode) 15 both submersed in a molten electrolyte 17. Electrical leads 19 and 21 provide connections to the negative and positive electrodes as shown. Lead 19 passes through a compressiontype seal 23 into contact with cathode 13 while electrical connection to the anode is provided by lead 21 attached to housing 11.\nCathode 13 is shown immersed in molten electrolyte 17 above anode 15. The cathode includes an electrically conductive support structure 25 and a plurality of electrically conductive screens or mesh 27 which serve as current collectors. The current collector mesh 27 is provided in a parallel stack across the cathode 13 with the open spaces filled with a cathode reactant material. The cathode reactant material includes a calcogen such as sulfur, selenium or tellurium. Preferably, sulfur or sulfur compounds, such as FeS2, FeS, CoS2, Cu2 S or mixtures thereof are employed. Various other suitable metallic sulfides are listed in the assignee's copending application Ser. No. 434,459, entitled \"Cathode for a Secondary Electrochemical Cell\" to Gay et al., filed Jan. 18, 1974.\nSurrounding the cathode structure is an electrically insulated and porous cloth 29. The cloth can be of boron nitride, calcium zirconate, yttria or other suitable, porous and electrically insulated fabric. Its purpose is to retain the cathode materials and to prevent electrical contact between the cathode and anode should the cell components swell or otherwisee move into physical contact. In some cells of this type, particularly where boron nitride cloth is used, a second interelectrode separator (not shown) of such as a calcium zirconate coated molybdenum screen can be interposed between the two electrodes.\nIn practice, various cell designs may be used with the improved anode of the present invention. The cell of FIG. 1 merely represents an example of the type cell used experimentally to test and prove the operability of the present invention. One other and perhaps more practical cell design which could be used in making up electrochemical batteries for off-peak storage of electrical power or as a power source for an electric vehicle is illustrated and described in the assignee's copending patent application entitled \"Modular Electrochemical Cell\" to Walsh et al., filed Nov. 15, 1973, Ser. No. 416,311, now U.S. Pat. No. 3,887,396.\nIn FIG. 1, anode 15 is shown disposed at the bottom of cell housing 11 slightly spaced from and in parallel alignment with cathode 13. The anode comprises a porous substrate 31 that is structurally supported on its top and bottom surfaces by metallic screens or mesh 33. As an optional feature, additional porous substrate material 35 can be placed along and in electrical contact with the vertical walls of housing 11. At the cell operating temperature (about 400\u00b0C.) porous substrate 31 is filled or impregnated with molten lithium metal or a molten combination or alloy of lithium and an additive metal such as copper.\nScreens 33 are of an electrically conductive material that is preferably wetted by molten lithium to enhance its retention. For example, about 20 U.S. standard mesh stainless steel or about 20 U.S. standard mesh mild carbon steel screen could be employed. Where carbon steel screens of low alloy content are employed, it is preferable that they be coated with a layer of cobalt metal in a similar manner as will be described hereinbelow in conjunction with the porous substrate 31.\nPorous substrate 31 is made up of a porous base structure with open and interconnected interstitial crevices. The base structure is of an electrically conductive material that is a suitable base for accepting a cobalt metal coating. As examples, porous iron, low alloy carbon steel, stainless steel or nickel can be used. The form of the base structure is preferably one that can be provided in an expanded condition for receiving the cobalt coating and subsequently compacted to form a porous substrate of 80% to 90% void volume (porosity) with open and interconnected, interstitial crevices coated with cobalt metal on essentially all surfaces. An entangled, fibrous, metallic mass is particularly suitable for this purpose. Other forms of the base structure might also include metallic foam, metallic felt, sintered masses of fibers or particles, stacks of metallic screens, or spiraled metallic ribbon.\nIn order to form porous substrate 31, the surfaces of the interstitial crevices, passageways or opening within the porous base structure are coated with a thin layer of cobalt metal. Essentially all of these surfaces are coated in order to provide maximum contact of molten lithium metal with the solid cobalt coating at the cell operating temperature. This contact is believed to provide a solid alloy with small amounts of lithium dissolved into the solid cobalt coating, thus enhancing wetting by the lithium metal and its retention within the porous substrate 31.\nA strongly bonded cobalt coating can be applied to the porous substrate by electroplating or electrodepositing from an aqueous solution. In order to insure a uniform and complete coverage of the base structure, the electroplating is performed with the base structure in an expanded or noncompacted form. For example, where entangled fibrous material such as steel wool is employed as the base structure, the pads can be slightly fluffed or pulled apart to a void volume of about 99% prior to the deposition of cobalt metal. The deposition process is continued until a sufficient coating thickness is produced to provide a thorough covering of the complete base structure. Coating thicknesses of about 2-12 microns with a minimum of about 5% of the fiber diameter are used.\nAlthough not presently tried, it is reasonable to assume that other processes involving decomposition of cobalt containing vapors could also be used in providing cobalt coatings on porous base structures. As an example, cobalt carbonyl, Co(CO)4, vapor could be thermally decomposed to provide a cobalt layer on a heated substrate. A method similar to that described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,833,421 to Rubishko et al. entitled \"Secondary Electrochemical Cells with a Chalcogen Cathode\", Sept. 3, 1974, could be used. This patent described the application of a chromium coating within a porous graphite substrate by the thermal decomposition of dicumene chromium (Cr[C6 H5 CH(CH3)2 ]2.\nIn selecting a porous based structure, inexpensive and commercially available steel wool appears to be a good choice. Steel wool of stainless steel or carbon steel can be selected from any of the steel wool classes listed below in Table I.\n\n               TABLE I______________________________________    Mean                    Surface    Diameter    Weight      AreaClass    (Microns)   g/m         cm.sup.2 /g______________________________________00       43.2        0.0113      1200        50.8        0.0157      1021        55.9        0.0189      92.8______________________________________\nA high surface area in the substrate is desirable for good lithium retention, thus making the finer fibers the preferred choice so long as a class so fine as to be excessively frangible is not selected.\nIn one manner of electroplating a cobalt coating onto an entangled mass of metallic fiber, such as steel wool of carbon steel, the base structure is first cleaned in accordance with well-known and documented cleaning procedures. One suitable procedure given in Hampel, The Encyclopedia of Electrochemistry, 549, Reinhold Publishing Corp., New York, 1964, is as follows:\n1. Soak in 2 M NaOH at 80\u00b0-95\u00b0C. for 2 to 4 min.\n2.Rinse in cold running water for 30 sec.\n3. Pickle in 30% by volume HCl for 60 sec.\n4. Rinse in running water for 30 sec.\n5. Anodic electroclean with 2 M NaOH at 80\u00b0-95\u00b0C. for 1 to 2 min.\n6. Rinse in cold running water for 30 sec.\n7. Acid dip in 5% by volume HCl for 30 sec.\n8.

In providing a crack-free deposit, pH, temperature, current densities, brighteners and mineral additives must be closely followed and considered.\nAs an example of a plating bath that has been employed in providing cobalt-coated substrates for use in experimental cells, the following composition is presented:\n\n CoSO.sub.4 . 7H.sub.2 O             300 g/literCoCl.sub.2 . 6H.sub.2 O             30 g/literH.sub.3 BO.sub.3  40 g/literSodium laurylsulfate (10% solution) 1 cc/liter\nThe following brighteners are also included:\n\n glyoxal (30% solution)               1       cc/literFeSO.sub.4          12      g/literZnSO.sub.4          1       g/liter\nA mass of loose noncompacted steel wool with a void volume of about 98.5 to 99.5% is electroplated by submerging it in a solution of this type along with a bar or the suitable supply of cobalt metal to replenish cobalt ions in solution. The submersed cobalt metal and steel wool are connected as electrodes at appropriate polarity to a source of electrical potential and an electroplating current of 2-20 mA/cm2, based on the surface area of the steel wool fibers, is passed through the solution at a pH of about 1.5 to 3.5. It is of importance to begin the electroplating at a low current density, e.g. 2 to 4 mA/cm2, in order to provide a uniform, crack-free deposit over all surfaces of the metallic fibers. Subsequent increases in current up to, for instance, 20 mA/cm2 will provide a rougher semibright surface that is of value in enhancing wetting and retention of the molten lithium metal within the anode.\nThe following examples are presented to illustrate electrochemical cells operated with the improved anode of the present invention.\nEXAMPLE I\nTwo experimental electrochemical cells were set up, each having two nearly identical electrodes of molten lithium metal impregnated into a porous substrate. This experimental work is also reported in \"Development of High-Specific-Energy Batteries for Electric Vehicles\", Progress Report for the Period August 1973 -- January 1974, ANL-8058, 1974, and \"High-Energy Battery Program at Argonne National Laboratory\", ANL-8064, 1974. The cells were operated at about 400\u00b0C. with the eutectic of LiCl-KCl employed as an electrolyte between the two lithium electrodes.\nIn the first cell, each of the two electrode substrates was a small pad of class 0 carbon steel wool with cobalt coating of about 6 microns on the steel fibers. Each pad was about 1.1 cm2, 0.21 cm thick and had a mass of about 0.24 gram, one-third of which was cobalt plating and the remainder steel wool fiber. Each pad had a total surface area of fibers of about 22 cm2. As described above, the substrates were electroplated with cobalt metal while expanded to about 99% void volume and compacted to about 85% void volume between two 20 U.S. standard mesh screens of carbon steel that were also cobalt plated. The porous substrates were submersed in molten liquid metal whereby each sorbed approximately 0.28 gram of lithium. Each of these loaded substrates was then electrochemically discharged to about 50% capacity to a reference aluminum electrode. The partially discharged lithium electrodes were then reassembled into an experimental Li/LiCl.KCl/Li cell and electrochemically cycled to evaluate the lithium retention properties of the lithium electrode porous substrates.\nDuring the first 37 cycles of the first cell operation, approximately 80% of the electrode capacity was transferred successfully in each half cycle at a current density of 400 mA/cm with coulombic efficiencies (discharge as a percentage of charge) greater than 98%. After the 37th cycle, the quantity of lithium transferred in each half cycle began to decrease, reaching a value of 0.64 A-hr by the 70th cycle and 0.4 A-hr by the 125th cycle. At the 75th cycle, the cutoff voltage for the charge of each electrode was increased from 0.09 volt to 0.12 volt to test the cell with essentially all of the lithium in the electrodes being cycled. Operation of the cell was terminated after 240 cycles (approximately 26 days) when the capacity had decreased fairly linearly since the 125th cycle to about 8% of its initial value. Throughout the entire test, the resistance of the cell remained nearly constant at 0.15 \u00b1 0.02 ohm and the coulombic efficiency was generally over 95%.\nIn order to illustrate the improvement afforded by the cobalt coating on the steel wool substrate, the second and nearly identical Li/LiCl-KCl/Li cell was operated. The only substantial difference in the structure of the two cells was that the cobalt coating on the steel wool base structure was omitted and each electrode of the second cell consisted of molten lithium metal impregnated into compacted steel wool between two 20-mesh carbon steel screens. Approximately 0.24 gram of steel wool was used in each electrode to provide equal substrate mass in the two cells. This second cell was cycled the first few times at only 200 mA/cm2 current density but after about 5 cycles was increased to the 400 mA/cm2 as in the first cell. A slightly higher voltage of 0.16 to 0.2 was required to obtain these current densities at 100% transfer of lithium between the two electrodes. The cell capacity decreased gradually during the first 30 or so cycles and then decreased abruptly, losing more than 90% of its initial capacity by the 45th cycle. The total duration of the cycling test was approximately 4-1/2 days.\nThe graph of FIG. 2 is presented to clearly illustrate the improvement in cell capacity and cycle life that can be attributed to the application of a cobalt coating into the interstitial crevices of the porous base structure containing molten lithium metal reactant. This graph clearly shows the increased capacity and cycle life of the cell having the improved anode with a cobalt-coated substrate.\nIn neither of the above-described cells was the cycle life particularly long prior to substantial loss of capacity. However, the mode of operation in both cells was severe (e.g. 400 mA/cm2 current density and near 100% discharge) in an attempt to induce failure. Furthermore, the cells were cycled unsealed within a furnace well having upper sections of reduced temperature that permitted condensation of potassium vapor produced by the reaction:\n\n Li + KCl \u2192 K + LiCl.\nThis source of lithium loss from the electrodes could be minimized through use of a sealed cell and longer cycle life perhaps could be obtained.\nEXAMPLE II\nAn electrochemical storage cell, ANL cell S-56, similar to that described and shown in FIG. 1 was assembled and operated to test a cobalt-coated substrate within the negative electrode. The cobalt-plated steel wool for this electrochemical cell was prepared in essentially the same manner as that for the laboratory cells described in Example I. Type 0 carbon steel wool was again employed and approximately 6 microns thickness of cobalt metal was electroplated onto the steel wool fibers. Two 20-mesh carbon steel screens with cobalt coatings were again used for support on either side of the steel wool substrate. Other physical design characteristics of the cell are given below in Table II:\n\n               TABLE II______________________________________Negative Electrode*Li-25 wt % Cu, g         23.7Electroylte              LiF--LiCl--KClPositive ElectrodeArea, cm.sup.2           42.7Active Material          FeS.sub.2 + Li.sub.2 SWeight, g                19.4Comp., wt %FeS.sub.2                33.5Li.sub.2 S               26.6Electrolyte              32.5Carbon Black             6.6Fe                       0.8Theoretical Capacity Density, A-hr/cm.sup.2                    0.28Theoretical Specific Capacity, A-hr/kg                    23.8Theoretical Capacity per Unit Volume ofSulfur Electrode, A-hr/cm.sup.3                    0.41Interelectrode Distance, cm                    0.60______________________________________ *A cobalt-coated steel wool substrate was used in contact with the bottom of the cell housing and stainless steel Feltmetal, 90% porosity, was used in contact with the cylindrical wall. The initial charge of lithium was sorbed only into the cobalt-coated substrate.\nThis cell was operated for over 65 cycles and 250 hours when it was voluntarily terminated. During this operating period, the cell was charged and discharged at a rate of 0.1 A/cm2 based on the positive electrode area. FIG. 3 shows the capacity density and the coulombic or amp-hr efficiency over a substantial portion of the cell life. At a charge cutoff voltage of 2.45 volts (IR included), a capacity density of about 0.11 A-hr/cm2 (38.7% of the theoretical capacity density based on positive electrode area) was measured to a 1.0 volt cutoff (IR included). The charged cutoff voltage was increased to 2.86 volts at about the 35th cycle with a resulting increase in the capacity density The coulombic efficiency decreased from 86% to 40% during the first 168 hours and 50 cycles. This was a result of electrolyte escape from the cell. On replacing the electrolyte, the cell performance increased substantially, as is shown in FIG. 3.\nThe results of this experimental electrochemical cell indicate that a cobalt-coated steel wool substrate can be employed for good retention of molten lithium metal within an electrochemical cell. The sustained levels of capacity density show that the lithium charge was being effectively cycled rather than lost from the substrate.\nIt can be seen from the above description and examples that the present invention provides a novel and improved anode structure for use in a high-temperature and high-capacity electrochemical cell. The anode structure can be a porous base structure of inexpensive carbon steel wool that is cobalt-coated to achieve improved retention of molten lithium metal. Although further improvements may still be required to provide a practical electrochemical cell for use within batteries for powering an electric vehicle or for off-peak storage of electrical energy, the present invention makes a substantial contribution towards enhanced cycle life and capacity of the electrochemical cells.\n", "claims": "\nThe embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows:\n \n1.

Many combinations of various components may be used, but some care is required to select only those combinations in which the solid products are nonvolatile at the temperatures encountered during the combustion. A representative system employes iron oxide and sodium azide according to the following reactions:", "background": "\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\nThere are many applications which require a storable source of gaseous nitrogen which may be used for a variety of pressurization or purging applications, for example. Nitrogen is inert with respect to many oxidizers, including the high energy interhalogen compounds such as ClF3 and ClF5, fluorine, oxygen, or various nitric acid compositions such as red fuming and white fuming nitric acid and many fuels such as hydrogen, hydrazine, kerosene, or other hydrocarbons. Thus, in rocket motors for example, it is possible to use nitrogen to pressurize or purge both fuel and oxidizer tanks. Nitrogen is also used in space station and vehicle atmospheres as a diluent for the oxygen. Thus, in the event of leakage not only will oxygen but also nitrogen will be lost and a storable means of replenishing nitrogen in the event of leaks is required. Nitrogen gas is also used in many laser applications and a storable source of gaseous nitrogen would be highly desirable, particularly for portable and military operations. In laser applications for example, it is also desirable that nitrogen contain amounts of other gases such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide or water.\nThere are three basic ways of storing nitrogen, i.e., as a gas, as a liquid, or chemically combined in a manner in which it can be controllably released. Storage as either gas or liquid is done by state-of-the-art techniques, but is associated with the problems inherent to pressurized gases or cryogenic liquids. A substantial body of art, therefore, has been developed towards making so-called nitrogen \"candles\" which are combustible compositions capable of liberating gaseous nitrogen. Such a composition is represented by U.S. Pat. No. 2,981,616 to Boyer for a Gas Generator Grain. The composition of this patent utilize a metal azide as a source of the nitrogen and an amount of oxidizing agent selected from the class of metal peroxides, inorganic perchlorates and metal nitrates in amounts sufficient to fully oxidize the metal component of the azide. Such compositions are capable of producing nitrogen gas, however, they are relatively energetic systems which can present safety hazards from inadvertent ignition. Further, these oxidizing agents produce high flame temperatures in the combustion process and in many cases the nitrogen gas evolved must be subsequently treated to cool it to a usable temperature and in some cases the temperature may also be so sufficiently high as to produce volatilization of some of the normally solid reaction products.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\nAccording to this invention, novel gas generator compositions have been discovered which have substantially no impact or friction sensitivity and which produce nitrogen gas or nitrogen mixed with other gases as the only volatile products at relatively low flame temperatures.\nThe desirable features of this invention are obtained by reacting metal azides with various metal oxides and salts as the oxidative reactant. To permit self-sustained combustion, the metal forming the azide should be sufficiently above the metal of the oxide or salt in the electromotive series of the elements so that the metal of the azide is capable of exothermically replacing the metal of the oxide or salt. To prevent the liberation of volatiles, other than the desired gases, the metal oxide or salt must be selected such that the residue produced by the reaction consists only of materials which are non-volatile under the reaction conditions. The general reaction sequence may be shown as follows: metal1 azide+metal2 oxide (or salt)\u2192metal1 oxide(or salt)+metal2 +nitrogen\nIn the above reaction metal1 is a metal which is higher in the electromotive series of the elements than metal2 and is capable of replacing the metal2 exothermically in the above general reaction scheme and the stoichiomety of the system is preferably adjusted to permit maximum liberation of the nitrogen of the azide and of metal2 together with the total substitution of metal1 in the oxide or salt.\nThe addition of a hydrogen-free carbon compound and an oxidizing agent for the carbon in amounts sufficient to convert desired amounts of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide may be made to the compositions of this invention to permit the generation of nitrogen - CO2 mixtures for use in lasers. Suitable carbon compounds include, without being limited to, carbonates, metal oxalates such as Li2 C2 O4, Na2 C2 O4, and MgC2 O4 and carbon-nitrogen compounds such as tetracyanoethylene (C6N4).\nElimination or reduction of the additional oxidizer will result in the evolution of carbon monoxide. Addition of hydrated materials or basic oxides such as Mg(ClO4)2.6H2 O, FeO2 H, oxamide and oxalic acid dihydrate either alone or in conjunction with the carbon compound will generate water. The formulas for oxamide and oxalic acid dihydrate are respectively (CO.NH2)2 and (COOH)2.2H2 O.\nRepresentative theoretical chemical reactions by which these gases may be generated are set forth

theoretical reactions and the actual experimental reactions noted in Table I, some differences between the experimental result and the theoretical expectations are observed. For example, in the reaction of aluminum fluoride with sodium azide, the reaction does not proceed to the production of aluminum nitride and sodium fluoride but rather Na3 AlF6 and AlN is produced. Also, as can be seen from the above table, it is not always possible to predict which combinations of materials will function properly according to this invention and in what particular relationship they may occur. For example, in the system using lithium azide, aluminum oxide, silicon dioxide, and 1 percent fiberglass reinforcement, no combustion was obtained when the mole ratio of the materials were respectively 12/6/39 and 25/6/90, yet good residue retention was obtained with a mole ratio of 24/6/39. It has not been determined if this was because of the increased amount of sodium azide, decreased amount of silicon oxide or some combination of the two with the latter being the most probable. Thus, while the applicant has not tested every combination of materials in all proportions to determine which do and which do not function to produce a gas generator grain capable of generating nitrogen in self sustained manner at reasonable temperatures, this disclosure is believed adequate to teach workers skilled in the art a new type of composition and how generally to determine which materials will work. Nevertheless, some experimentation, well within ordinary skill, will be required by workers skilled in the art to select the precise composition for any particular combination of materials within the scope of this disclosure and the claims but which are not specifically disclosed by example herein. While this invention has been illustrated with respect to numerous examples, the invention is not limited thereto and various modifications can be made by workers skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention which is limited only by the following claims wherein:\n", "claims": "\nWe claim:\n \n1.

No. 164,410, filed July 20, 1971, now abandoned.\nThis invention relates to electrode assemblies for use in electro-chemical test or measurement, and is concerned more particularly with glass electrode assemblies of the kind in which the electrical conductor in contact with the electrolyte is connected to the output terminal through a screened electrical lead.\nIn the past glass electrode assemblies using screened electrical leads comprise inner and outer glass tubes which co-operate to provide an annular chamber for the screening, the glass member providing the membrane of the electrode being sealed to an exposed end of the inner tube, one end of the outer tube being sealed to the inner tube in the region adjacent the exposed end thereof, and the conductor being sealed in the opposite end of the inner tube and in contact with the electrolyte in the inner tube. These glass electrode assemblies were difficult to manufacture. In particular it was difficult to anneal the glass in the sealing regions, giving rise to inherent mechanical stress in the glass. The only ways possible of fastening the lead to the conductor resulted in a large volume for the electrode space and the danger of unsatisfactory operation if the assembly was not in a substantially upright position.\nOne object of the present invention is to provide a glass electrode assembly having a screened electrical lead which involves less elaborate glass working and a much simpler and more effective screening arrangement than in the prior known electrode assemblies. A further object of the invention is to provide an electrode assembly in which the electrolyte space can be small and can be substantially filled with electrolyte, with a corresponding improvement in performance over the prior known electrode assemblies.\nAccording to the present invention there is provided an electrochemical electrode assembly comprising a tube of glass terminating in a glass member defining a glass membrane, said member containing a quantity of electrolyte liquid in contact with the internal surface of said membrane, the external surface of said membrane being externally accessible, closure means retaining the electrolyte in said tube, an electrical conductor passing through said closure means and extending into said electrolyte, an electrical lead extending into said tube and connected to said conductor, and an electrical screen surrounding said lead and extending to the proximity of said closure means, said closure means being made of a resilient electrically-insulating material and being of a size such that it is compressed by said tube and provides a sealing fit against the inside wall of the tube and the electrical conductor so as to form an electrically insulating barrier between the electrolyte and said electrical screen.\nThe electrode assembly of the invention may be manufactured by providing a glass tube having a substantially cylindrical portion terminating in a glass member providing a glass membrane, inserting electrolyte in said member, providing a closure plug of resilient electrically-insulating material of a size adapted to be a sealing fit within said cylindrical portion to retain said electrolyte in said member, said closure plug having an electrical conductor embedded in and passing therethrough, providing an electrical lead having a surrounding electrical screen and connecting said lead to said conductor, inserting a length of wire or other strip element into said tube at the end remote from said member, inserting said closure plug into said tube at the end remote from said glass member and moving the closure plug along the tube to the proximity of said glass member so that the conductor is in contact with the electrolyte, said wire extending between the plug and the wall of the glass tube and deforming the wall of the plug to form a groove therein which permits escape of air from said glass member, and withdrawing the wire from between the closure plug and the wall of the tube.\nAn embodiment of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawing, in which:\nFIG. 1 is an elevation view of an electrode assembly manufactured in accordance with the method of the present invention.\nFIG. 2 is a sectional view of the lower end of the glass tube of the assembly fitted with the membrane and containing the electrolyte, the closure plug and the electrode conductor, and\nFIG. 3 illustrates the components of the electrode assembly at one stage in the manufacture of the assembly.\nReferring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the electrode assembly comprises an outermost cylindrical glass tube 1 which at its lower end at 2 is sealed to a glass member 3 at least part of which is formed as a thin glass membrane. The sealing of the tube to the member 3 results in a slight reduction of diameter as shown. The chamber formed by the lower end of the tube and the member 3 contains electrolyte 4, and an electrode conductor 5 has its lower end immersed in the electrolyte.\nThe electrode conductor 5 is in the form of a wire which is embedded in and extends through a closure plug 6 made of inert resilient electrical-insulating material, such as silicone rubber. The plug 6 has a cylindrical outer wall of a diameter slightly larger than the internal diameter of the glass tube 1 so that it is compressed when in position in the glass tube and is thus a tight sealing fit around its full periphery against the inside wall of the tube 1. The lower end of the plug 6 is conical to facilitate insertion of the plug into the top open end of the glass tube. The upper end of the plug 6 is of reduced diameter and fits within the lower end of an inner tube or sleeve 7, which can be of any suitable material, preferably of nylon, though it can be of polypropylene, or other similar material. The upper end of the plug 6 also has a central recess 8 which receives the end of a cable 9. The cable 9 is of the coaxial screened type, comprising an innermost central conductor 10, an insulator 11, a braided or laid electric conductive screening sheath 12 and an outer impervious insulating layer 13. The electrode conductor 5 passes through the plug 6 into the central recess 8 and is soldered or otherwise connected at 14 to the central conductor 10 of the cable. The screening sheath 12 of the cable and the outer insulating layer 13 are stripped back a short distance from the junction point 14 with the electrode conductor wire, as shown, and the end of the cable is sealed within the recess 8 by an inserted sealing material 15. This material should be flexible, and is conveniently an RTV sealant which is identified commercially as room temperature vulcanising (R.T.V.) sealant though other rubber based or rubber like sealants can be used.\nAt the upper end of the sleeve 7 the cable 9 passes through a further locating plug 16 fitting within the upper end of the tube 7. The plug 16 is formed with a head as at 17 which is a sealing fit within the outer tube 1. Alternatively the zone at 16 can be filled with a suitable resilient sealing means, such as R.T.V. The upper end of the assembly is covered and protected by a cap 18. The cap can be of plastics material, or of metal such as anodised aluminium and is preferably a friction fit on the tube 1. The cap may be sealed to or fixed to the tube, for example by adhesive. The end of the cable 9 carries a connecting plug 19.\nIn the assembly of the electrode the glass tube 1 is mounted in an upright position and the electrolyte liquid fed into the bottom of the tube 1. It is essential that none of the electrolyte comes into contact with the wall of the tube at the part thereof occupied by the plug 6 in the assembled electrode since this would form an electric track past the plug. For this reason the electrolyte is preferably inserted in the tube by a syringe having an outlet nozzle which extends to the bottom of the tube.\nThe cap 18, the locating plug 16, 17, and the sleeve 7 are then threaded in succession onto the cable 9, the central conductor 10 soldered to the electrode conductor 5 and the recess filled with the sealing material 15. The plug 6 together with the cable 9 is then ready for insertion in the glass tube 1.\nIt is however not possible merely to insert the plug 6 into the open end of the tube and then force the plug down the tube, for the reason that the closure plug is a sealing fit against the inside wall of the tube 1 and the air in the tube would be compressed, and if the plug was forced down to the position shown in FIG. 2 the pressure of air would either fracture the thin glass membrane at the bottom of the tube or tend to force the plug back up towards the top of the glass tube. It is a feature of the present invention that, prior to or simultaneously with insertion of the closure plug 6 into the glass tube 1, a thin wire 20 is inserted into the glass tube 1 through the open upper end thereof, as shown in FIG. 3. The plug 6, together with the sleeve 7 and cable 9, can then be moved downwards inside the tube 1 to the position shown in FIG. 2. The wire 20 extends between the plug and the wall of the glass tube and deforms the wall of the plug to form a groove 21 therein. The wall of the plug, even though it is compressed by the wall of the tube, does not completely fill the junction between the wire 20 and the wall of the tube 1 so that clearance passages are formed alongside the wire through which the air in the tube can escape past the plug when the plug is moved downwards to the position shown in FIG. 2. The wire 20 may be anchored to the top of the tube during the insertion of the plug 6, or alternatively the wire can be positioned alongside the plug and the wire and plug fed simultaneously into and down the tube. It is however essential that the wire 20 should not dip into the electrolyte since, in this event, when it was withdrawn the wire would smear electrolyte between the plug and the wall of the tube and form a track for electric current.\nWhen the plug 6 is in the desired position in the tube 1, the wire 20 is withdrawn and the top of the tube sealed by the plug 16, 17 and cap 18. Upon withdrawal of the wire 20, the plug 6 expands into the space previously occupied by the wire and thereby provides an electrically insulating barrier between the electrolyte and the screening sheath 12 on the cable.\n", "claims": "\nI claim:\n \n1.

In this manner the operating cycle of the device is only initiated at the time the operation of the device is required. Such devices have been described as \"reserve\" cells in that the energy output is withheld or reserved until required. Moreover in such devices it is required that the operation of the device be positive and foolproof. Further, recently it has become desirable to provide cells and batteries with high voltage electrochemical couples. The advantages therein lie in that the voltage from each cell couple is in the order of 2 volts to 3.5 volts. Such high energy electrochemical couples are based primarily on the use of highly active anodic metals. These active metals are those which lie above hydrogen in the electrochemical series i.e., they are capable of displacing hydrogen from water. Because of this capability of displacing hydrogen from water, water-based electrolytes cannot be safely used therewith. When water is used in conjunction with high energy electrochemical couples and particularly such couples involving anodic materials such as lithium, sodium, potassium and calcium, contact of the electrolyte with the anodic material will liberate copious amounts of hydrogen and oxygen which upon accumulation within the cell chamber may form explosive mixtures. For this reason it is preferred to use organic electrolytes in conjunction with such materials. Consequently the electrolyte should be based upon organic solvents.\nMany of the organic electrolyte cells consist of: (a) active, high-voltage, light metal anodes such as lithium, (b) a wide variety of depolarizers including metal halides, oxides, perioxides, chromates, permanganates, periodates, molybdates, vanadates, arsenates, phosphates, sulfates, etc. and (c) a wide variety of electrolytes consisting of organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, propylene carbonate, gamma-butyrolactone, dimethylsulfite, N-nitrosodimethylamine, methylformate, dimethylcarbonate, N:N dimethylformamide, butylformate, acetonitrile, dimethoxyethane, dimethylsulfoxide etc. with a wide variety of dissolved active metal salts such as perchlorates, tetrachloroaluminates, tetrafluoroborates, chlorides, hexafluorophosphates, hexafluoroarsenates, etc. of the active metals. Such cells, when the electrodes are maintained immersed in the electrolytes even though the electrochemical circuit is not completed, show a degradation of performance on prolonged storage at elevated temperatures. This problem is due to spontaneous chemical reaction between the electrolyte and the extremely active anode and cathode materials. This problem is usually eliminated by using a reserve cell structure for these cells wherein the electrolyte is stored in a separate compartment away from the active electrodes and when needed the cell is activated by releasing the electrolyte into the electrode chamber by suitable means.\nTHE INVENTION\nI have invented a reserve cell structure suitable for use with organic electrolyte cells and using for activation a commercially available activating device such as the device described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,484,297 (Zaleski).\nThe object of this invention is to provide a novel reserve structure for the organic electrolyte cells which has the advantages of high voltage; high energy density; high volumetric and gravimetric efficiency; long shelf life; low cost; durability; easy, reliable, disposable activation means; quick activation; multiplate cellular structure; and unitary battery construction which is capable of quick activation. These advantages and further objects of the present invention will become apparent from the following description.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\nFIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of the reserve cell structure according to this invention with parts cut away to show the internal construction thereof and\nFIG. 2 shows a multi-cell reserve battery construction with parts cut away to show the arrangement of the cells to form a battery and showing the safety devices to prevent accidental activation or actuation of the reserve battery.\nIn the schematic drawing of the reserve structure in FIG. 1, the interior of the cell is shown in partial section. The prismatic cell 1 includes casing 1a which is preferably made of a nickel-plated steel or of molded polymers, such as polyolefins or phenolics, or other rigid materials capable of resisting atmospheric and chemical corrosion. Groove 2 placed just above electrode stack 3 is incorporated into the cell casing la in order to provide a demarkation of the electrolyte compartment 6a and to provide a support for a prismatic electrolyte containing capsule or reservoir 6. The electrode stack 3 includes a parallel plate stack of rectangular anodes 3a and cathodes 3b. Between the electrodes is positioned bibulous separator material 3c  inert to the electrolyte and the electrodes. The cathode terminals are connected to a common tab 4a which in turn is connected to a glass-metal seal terminal 4 attached to the cell top 5 to provide external terminals for the cell 1. The anode terminals are similarly connected to the casing 1a via a common tab (not shown).\nThe prismatic electrolyte capsule 6 in compartment 6a provided with a circular opening on one side is molded from flexible polymeric material, such as phenolics, diallyphthalates or high density polyolefins. On the side adjacent to the electrodes an opening is provided which is closed by a frangible thin walled sealing lid 8. An impact transmitting bar 7, consisting of three or more vertical impact bars 7a, with a flat circular disc 7b at the top is placed inside the electrolyte capsule 6 with the flat disc 7b placed opposite to the lid 8 of the capsule 6. The inner wall of the capsule 6 is sealed to this flat disc 7b. The capsule 6 is filled with electrolyte and a circular thin walled sealing lid 8 is placed over the circular opening of the capsule and sealed to the capsule. A layer of polyethylene may be used between the two pieces. The capsule 6 is then inverted so that the capsule lid end faces the electrode stack 3 and the entire capsule 6 is then positioned in the electrolyte compartment 6a to rest on groove 2 of the cell case 1 directly above the electrode stack 3. Cell top 5 consists of nickel-plated steel lid with a central orifice 9 for the contact positioning of the spring loaded plunger 10 of the standard activation mechanism according to U.S. Pat. No. 3,484,297 in contact with bellows 11. The glass-to-metal seal cathode terminal 4 is attached to cell top 5. The inner side of the nickel-plated steel cell top 5 is hermetically heat sealed to a flexible polyethylene aluminum foil laminate bellows 11 of capsule 6. Cell top 5 is sealed to the cell case 1a after incorporation of the electrode stack 3 and the positioning of the electrolyte capsule 6 in the cell case 1a.\nBellows 11 is free at the central part where it rests within the electrolyte compartment 6a and in contact with capsule 6 inside the cell casing 1a and the spring loaded plunger 10 outside of the cell. A metal protective disc may be protectively placed below the plunger head 10a and the bellows 11 in order to protect the capsule 6 from puncture when it is impacted by the spring loaded plunger 10 during activation. Cell top 5 is also fitted with a pair of clasps 12 for retaining the activation mechanism housing 14. These clasps permit the positioning of the separable activation mechanism 15 just prior to activation and the removal of the activating mechanism 15 after activation. The activation mechanism 15 is capable of interchangeable reuse for cells of this type.\nThe disposable activation mechanism 15 includes a spring loaded plunger 10 which is restrained by a pin 13. Twisting of the activation mechanism housing 14 causes pin 13 to slip through a hole (not shown) in the top of housing 14 thus releasing the spring and the plunger 10 which impacts the electrolyte capsule 6 through bellows 11 and the impact transmitting bar 7 which thereupon breaks the thin frangible lid 8 and compresses the electrolyte capsule 6 thus releasing and expelling the electrolyte into the electrode stack 3 and thus activating the cell 1. Pin 13 is prevented from slipping through the hole (not shown) in the housing 14 by safety pin 15 which has to be removed prior to cell activation by twisting off of the housing 14. The activation mechanism housing 14 along with the spring and the plunger 10 is automatically released from cell top clasp 12 after activation.\nThe electrode stacks 3 may be connected in series or parallel and by packaging them in a battery case 50a as shown by FIG. 2. The battery 50 shown in FIG. 2 consists of 6 cells 30.\nThe simultaneous activation of all the cells 30 of battery 50 of FIG. 2 is achieved by slight modifications of the activation mechanism 14 of FIG. 1. This is accomplished by removal of all of the restraining pins 42 of the spring-loaded plungers 41 of activators 40 of all the cells by means of ripcord 43 interconnected to all of the pins 42. The handle of the ripcord is secured at one end of the battery in safety catch 44. The activation mechanism housings 40 may be removed after use by pushing them from one side to dislodge them from cell top clasps 45.\nThe reserve cell structures of this invention are applicable to a variety of organic electrolyte batteries and generally to all hermetically sealed batteries.\nVarious modifications of the above reserve structures are easily derived by those skilled in the art from the specific preferred structures of the preferred embodiment hereinabove described. Such modifications which may be useful for certain specific applications include cylindrical construction rather than the prismatic construction set forth herein. Pre-molding of all the activation mechanism housing clasps 45 of all the cells 30 in a battery into a single plastic case 50a so that all the activation housings 40 can be removed in a single disengaging operation is a similar modification. The use of spring loading or lever actuation in the design of the ripcord mechanism 43 so that all of the retaining pins 42 and retaining activator plunger 41 may be released, by release of one single activating arm is also possible. Further, the invention includes providing a single spring loaded activation housing mechanism removal means, so that after activation the disengagement of a single member will remove the entire activation mechanism from the complete battery 50. These and other modifications of the basic design of my invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art and such modifications within the scope of this invention are intended to be included within the ambit of this invention.\n", "claims": "\nWhat is claimed is:\n \n1.

No. 185,836, filed 1 Oct. 1971, now abandoned, which is in turn a Division of Ser. No. 64,419, 08/17/70, also now abandoned.\nThe present invention relates to a method of making zinc-containing electrodes and, more particularly, to a method of making a zinc-containing negative electrode for use in alkaline storage cells or batteries and, preferably, as counterelectrodes to silver/silver oxide and nickel/nickel oxide electrodes in such batteries.\nThe use of zinc as in electrochemically active substance as in electrode material in alkaline, acid or neutral electrolytes has been widespread over the years because of the high reactivity and electronegativity of zinc in substantially all environments. Problems such as the autosolubilization of zinc metal, which have frequently concerned the art, have in part been solved by amalgamation of the zinc.\nWhen, however, zinc-containing electrodes are to constitute the negative electrode of an alkaline accumulator, storage cell or battery, however, a host of special problems are encountered. Firstly, metallic zinc and its alloys are readily soluble in the alkaline electrolyte and, consequently, the discharge/charge cycle corresponds to a solubilization of zinc in the electrolyte and the formation of zincate ions, and the redeposition of zinc upon the electrode from the solution respectively. The replating or redeposition of zinc occurs in the form of treed or branched crystals having sharp points (dendrites) which readily bridge the gap between the plates of opposite polarity, thereby causing short circuits and the destruction of the cell. Where dendrite formation is not a problem because of the wide spacing of the plates, the cell has a low power-to-volume or power-to-weight ratio. It has been proposed to provide wrappings or the like of cellophane about the zinc electrode, the cellophane constituting a semipermeable membrane separation between opposite-polarity plates, but this expedient has reduced the number of charge/discharge cycles which the cell is able to tolerate and has also reduced power output, discharge rate and charging rate. Another problem frequently encountered in connection with zinc negative electrodes is that of \"shape change\" since the redeposition of zinc-containing material from solution does not generally occur uniformly over the entire surface of the plate.\nIt is, therefore, the principal object of the present invention to provide a negative zinc-containing plate for alkaline accumulators (i.e. alkaline storage batteries or cells) which permits an increased number of charge/discharge cycles and yet restricts dendrite formation and the tendency to form short-circuit bridges between the opposite-polarity plates or electrodes.\nAnother object of this invention is to provide an improved storage cell or battery with elevated cycle life, reduced tendency to breakdown by short-circuit, and freedom from the other problems hitherto with dendrite growth in zinc-containing alkaline cells.\nIt is also an object of the invention to provide an improved method of making such an electrode.\nThese objects and others which will become apparent hereinafter, are attained, in accordance with the present invention, with a negative electrode for alkaline accumulators in which the active mass (i.e. the mass participating in a principal electrochemical reaction at the electrode) comprises zinc or a zinc compound and is present in association with at least one substance capable of forming corresponding zincates of low solubility in the electrolyte during discharge of the plate. The substance, which is capable of forming the low solubility zincates, according to this invention, is preferably an alkaline-earth-metal hydroxide with the compound formed being the corresponding low solubility alkaline-earth-metal zincate. Of particular suitability, in this connection, is calcium hydroxide although magnesium hydroxide may also be used. In the first case, the product is calcium sincate while in the second case it is magnesium sincate. Surprisingly, the alkaline-earth zincates resulting from the substantially instantaneous reaction of the alkaline-earth hydroxide and the solubilizing zinc during discharge, does not irreversibly remove the reacted zinc from the system in terms of the active mass; moreover, it has been found that the zinc redeposits or replates from the low solubility zincate, in the form of a porous spongy mass. While it is doubtful that the spongy porous mass is formed directly from the precipitated alkaline-earth zincate, this hypothesis cannot be excluded although it is assumed that the small quantity of this low-solubility compound which is in the solution, is readily depleted by electrodeposition and galvanic techniques and is replenished from the low-solubility salt which is precipitated from the solution.\nAccording to the principles of the present invention, therefore, the zinc or zinc compounds incorporated in the negative electrode plate for an alkaline accumulator are mixed with an auxiliary substance tending to form low-solubility salts with the zinc as it goes into solution during discharge of the cell, i.e. low-solubility zincate salts. From the low-solubility compounds thus formed, sponge zinc precipitates on the plate during charging of the cell without dendrite formation.\nAccording to a further feature of this invention, a negative electrode plate containing zinc as an electrochemically active metal, comprises an inner conductive grid or current distributor collector, e.g. a metal foil or wire mesh, which is imbedded on all sides in a mixture of zinc or a zinc compound and the auxiliary substance capable of forming low-solubility zinc salts, the mass being packed around the conductive support. In this construction, the supply of electric current to the plate as well as the withdrawal of electric current therefrom takes place at the center of the plate, i.e. in the immediate vicinity of the conductive grid or support, whereby the conversion of metallic zinc to low-solubility zinc compounds during discharge is effected from the center outwardly in a progressive fashion. The reduction of the zinc compounds during charging of the cell, conversely, takes place from the interior outwardly as a result of the low conductivity of the slightly soluble compounds.\nIt has been found to be advantageous to provide the electrochemically active mass (i.e. zinc or zinc compounds) in a porous form and, in addition, to provide means for preventing the mixture from sloughing or breaking away from the plate. The latter means, according to the invention, may include a porous synthetic-resin layer surrounding the porous mass which, in turn, surrounds the conductive support on all sides. The porous synthetic-resin layer may be a fabric (woven) or a fleece, or felt mat of filaments (nonwoven) and it is an important aspect of this invention that the pores of this synthetic resin layer or sheet are at least partly filled with the auxiliary substance, i.e. an alkaline-earth metal hydroxide and especially calcium hydroxide. Best results are obtained when the supporting wrapping of synthetic-resin layers is carried by the conductive support, e.g. via spacers which define the thickness of the deposit of the active mass packed around this support.\nThe invention also relates to an improved method of making the electrode. In accordance with these aspects of the invention, the zinc or zinc compounds and the auxiliary substances are electrochemically deposited upon the conductive support from an electrolyte. The electrolyte contains, in addition to zinc ions and ions of the auxiliary substance designed to provide low-solubility synthetic salts, ions of a substance which is reduced by hydrogen-ion consumption. When the metallic grid or support is subjected to a cathodic polarization in this electrolyte, the resulting precipitate consists of spongy metallic zinc, zinc hydroxide and calcium hydroxide in a porous mass. It is indeed unusual that both the metallic zinc and the zinc hydroxide are deposited simultaneously and, in view of the fact that the low solubility zincate salt is formed during discharge of the plate, that all three of the components (zinc, zinc hydroxide and calcium hydroxide) are electrodeposited simultaneously. The consumption of hydrogen ions in the reduction of the further ions mentioned earlier permits a shift in the pH value during the process, apparently thereby yielding zinc hydroxide and calcium hydroxide. Best results are obtained when nitrate ions are present in the electrolyte as consumers of hydrogen ion.\nAccording to still another feature of this invention, the zinc and/or zinc compounds and the auxilieary substance capable of forming low-solubility zincates, are deposited from solution by electrodeposition or electrolysis techniques. The process may be carried out by substitution of electrolytes so that, for example, the concentration of zinc ion, calcium ion and nitrate ion and the ratios of one to the others can be varied freely. The system allows numerous variations which will be readily apparent, since the alkaline-earth-metal hydroxide can be deposited exclusively or in combination with zinc and/or zinc hydroxide in accordance with the principles of the invention. Consequently, it is advantageous to initially constitute the electrolyte such that a preponderance of zinc and/or zinc hydroxide or an excess over the calcium hydroxide is deposited in a first stage from one electrolyte, while equimolar quantities of calcium hydroxide and zinc and/or zinc hydroxide are deposited in the next stage. The last layer can, of course, be calcium hydroxide exclusively so that a sheath thereof is provided as a protective layer for the electrode, the sheath preventing undesirable reactions between the active materials and the other materials of the system.\nOf course, it is also possible to prepare the electrode of the present invention by mechanically mixing zinc or zinc compounds with the alkaline-earth-metal compounds and to form a paste from the mixture which is applied to the support; alternatively, the support may be imbedded in the paste so that in either case the support or grid is fully surrounded by the active material. This system may, however, be combined with the system previously described so that, for example, a pasted plate may be coated with zinc and/or zinc hydroxide and/or calcium hydroxide by electrodepositing methods as set forth earlier, or an electrodeposited mass of zinc and/or zinc hydroxide and/or calcium hydroxide may be coated with a paste of zinc and/or zinc compounds and/or calcium hydroxide. Best results are obtained when the final (outermost) layer is a layer of electrodeposited calcium hydroxide. The electrode may be wrapped in a porous synthetic-resin layer as noted above, the pores of this layer being at least in part filled with an auxiliary substance as mentioned earlier. It has been discovered that deposition of the auxiliary substances in the pores ccan be conveniently carried out by initially immersing the synthetic-resin layer in a solution of alkaline-earth-metal ions and thereafter dipping the impregnated layer into an alkaline solution (e.g. aqueous sodium or potassium hydroxide). As a result, the corresponding alkaline-earth-metal hydroxide will be formed in the wrapping layer. Moreover, the process may be repeated several times to obtain the desired concentration of the alkaline-earth-metal hydroxide in the wrap.\nAccording to another feature of this invention, following the preparation of the electrode as described above, the electrode which may have variation concentrations of zinc, zinc hydroxide, before or after application of the wrap, and alkaline-earth-metal hydroxide, is subjected to cathodic reformation in an alkaline electrolyte to convert substantially all of the zinc hydroxide to finely divided metallic zinc in uniform and intimate contact with the calcium hydroxide. Upon charging and discharging of the electrode, dendrite formation is excluded while other parameters of the electrode are not substantially changed.\nThe above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent hereinafter, reference being made to the accompanying drawing in which:\nFIG. 1 is a flow diagram illustrating the invention; and\nFIG. 2 is an electrode as made by the process.\nThe electrode shown in FIG. 2 comprises a metallic support 1 in the form of a wire grid of zinc-plated copper to which a terminal tab 2 is spot-welded. On the edges and in the middle of the support 1, there are provided on both sides of the support, spacers 3 in the form of plexiglass rods or ribs, held in place by cement. The space within the outlines of the plate and flush with the rods 3 is filled with the active material in three layers 4, 5, 6. The inner layer 4 is a zinc-enriched layer in which the zinc molar concentration exceeds the calcium molar fraction while the second layer 5 is calcium hydroxide rich in the sense that the molar concentration of zinc or zinc compounds. The layer 6 consists exclusively of calcium hydroxide and the plate is surrounded by a layer 7, wrapped therearound, consisting of porous synthetic resin, e.g. a nonwoven fabric of hylon filament, impregnated with calcium hydroxide.\nIn FIG. 1, there is represented the several stages of the present process in flow-diagram form. A grid 10 may be supplied to an electrolytic deposition stage 11, the electrolyte containing nitrate ion, zinc ion, calcium ion and hydrogen ion, to produce a plate at 12 in which the active material consists of zinc, zinc hydroxide and calcium hydroxide. Where desired, this plate may be provided as shown at 13 and 14 with a pasted layer of zinc, oxide or hydroxide and/or calcium oxide or hydroxide. Alternatively, the grid may be supplied at 15 to station 14 at which a zinc hydroxide/zinc oxide and calcium hydroxide/calcium oxide plate is prepared. The plates obtained at 12 and 16 may be led to a further station 17 at which calcium hydroxide is electrodeposited thereon as the outer sheath, the resulting plate being subjected to cathodic reformation at 18 to convert the zinc hydroxide to finely divided metallic zinc. Alternatively, the plate 12 may be led at 19 to the cathodic reformation stage and only thereafter will the outer layer calcium hydroxide be applied as shown at 20. The resulting plates, with or without a final cathodic reformation as shown in 21 and 22 may be wrapped at 23 and introduced into an alkaline cell with nickel or silver counterelectrodes as shown in 24. The plate 25 obtained from the cathodic reformation stage may be similarly introduced directly into the cell. The wrapping may be followed by cathodic reformation as shown at 76.\nEXAMPLE I\nA zinc-plated wire mesh of rectangular configuration and having dimensions of 31 \u00d7 51 mm is provided with a metal tab by spot-welding and is formed with spacer ribs along the edges on both sides of the support. The spacers are composed of plexiglass and are cemented to the wire grid. The electrode thus prepared is immersed in an electrolyte containing 600 gr/liter of zinc chloride and 200 gr/liter of calcium nitrate in water, the bottom of the vessel being provided with a layer of zinc oxide. Using the electrode as a cathode against a zinc anode, electrolysis is carried out for two hours at a current of 0.5 amperes. Thereafter, the electrode is cathodically electrolyzed in an electrolyte containing 800 gr/liter of calcium nitrate over a period of one half hour with a current of 0.3 amperes. The electrode is then immersed in an aqueous potassium hydroxide solution (37%) and electrolyzed for 20 hours with a current of 0.1 amperes. In this last step, zinc compounds previously deposited are converted into metallic zinc. The electrode is then dipped, after rinsing in a mercury chloride solution to amalgamate the zinc. Under light pressure, a nonwoven synthetic-resin layer (Viledon) is wrapped around the electrode and cemented to the spacers. The electrode is then dipped in a calcium chloride solution and then again in a potassium hydroxide solution to precipitate calcium hydroxide in the pores of the wrap. The electrode 6 is then used in a storage battery in which nickel III oxide constituted the counterelectrode or in combination with an air electrode in a zinc/air battery. In each case, potassium hydroxide served as the electrolyte. The plate had a capacity of 1.4 ampere hours corresponding to 10.5 ampere hours/decimeter2 of apparent surface. Repeated charge/discharge cycling showed no evidence of dendrite formation.\nEXAMPLE II\nUpon the grid prepared as in EXAMPLE I, a viscous paste was coated flush with the spacers, the paste consisting of equal parts by weight of zinc oxide and calcium hydroxide in the presence of sufficient water to impart a pasty consistency to the mass. After drying, a zincate resin layer of nonwoven fabric as described in Example I was supplied and the plate thereafter electrolyzed in an electrolyte containing 800 gr./liter of calcium nitrate as described in Example I. After a cathodic treatement in potassium hydroxide solution, the electrode was found to have a capacity of 1.1 ampere hours.\nEXAMPLE III\nFollowing the procedure outlined in Example II up to the provision of the synthetic-resin layer of nonwoven fabric, the electrode was cathodically electrolyzed in a solution containing 400 gr./liter of zinc chloride and 400 gr./liter of calcium nitrate for one half hour at a current of 0.5 amperes. The electrode was then processed in the calcium nitrate solution as described in Examples I and II. The electrode was subsequently cathodically treated in potassium hydroxide solution and was found to have a capacity of 1.6 ampere hours.\n", "claims": "\nI claim:\n \n1.
