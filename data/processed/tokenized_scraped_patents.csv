This cell comprises a combined prismatic electrode chamber overlayed with a compartment containing the electrolyte. The electrolyte is prevented from access to the electrode chamber, by a frangible sealing means. The reserve cell is designed to be rapidly actuated by a separable actuator means of which the reserve cell actuator means described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,484,297 is preferred. The electrolyte compartment is completely lined with an electrolyte impermeable lining forming the electrolyte container which is collapsible. Upon actuation the applied pressure forcibly expels the electrolyte from the electrolyte container into the electrode chamber. This cell is particularly adapted for use with high energy electromotive couples including those dependent on active anodic metals above hydrogen in the electrochemical series and particularly such metals as lithium, calcium, sodium and potassium.","['https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/8d/24/c6/1414d797c35c6f/US3930885-drawings-page-2.png',

A temporary base is coated by electroplating with a thin, unbroken and unpatterned metallic layer having a thickness less than 17 μm and the free surface of said metallic layer is bonded to a final insulating base. The temporary base is thereafter removed and the desired wiring pattern is produced by a process comprising etching of the metal layer. A material for use in production of printed circuits is also disclosed comprising a temporary base which is coated by electroplating with a thin, unbroken and unpatterned metal layer having a thickness less than 17 μm. Said material can comprise a final, insulating base bonded to the free surface of the thin metal layer. The temporary base may be comprised of an aluminum foil coated with a layer of zinc or an aluminum foil to which has been applied zinc and which has the zinc replaced electrochemically by half or partly, by a layer of a metal which is more electro-positive than the metal zinc. In electroplating a thin, unbroken and unpatterned metallic layer onto the temporary base the electroplating takes place in a solution containing copper, pryophosphate and an acid, the pK-value of which is at least 0.8 at 20°C.","['https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/55/5b/a0/64414e7b5c06a4/US3936548-drawings-page-2.png',

Tree formation can be prevented if the insulation is initially dry and the cable construction is such that moisture cannot gain access to the insulation under operating conditions encountered during installation and underground use. This invention eliminates initial moisture and has a construction that greatly retards ingress of moisture to the insulation during installation when the cable is in service and prevents longitudinal movement of water along the cable due to accidental damage to the cable or electrical failure.,['https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/88/2c/ee/dd454d7f7b248f/US3943271-drawings-page-2.png'],"['H', 'H01', 'H01B', 'H01B7/00', 'H01B7/17', 'H01B7/28', 'H01B7/2813', 'H', 'H01',
